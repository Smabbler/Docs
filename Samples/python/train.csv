11,"Yes, that is acne, basically blocked pores. It is fairly common but it shows far more on light coloured cats. I have to say I use a clean fingernail if I see any on my cats but if you don't approve of that, they can usually be washed away. It is better not to leave them even though they are no problem as they are because cats under stress can have infections in that area if they have acne.",ASC102
12,Yes it could be feline acne - my old Harrycat (RIP) had a bad flare up one year. Can't remember if he had antibiotics but I do remember having to wash his chin with a weak solution of Hibiscrub.

14,"If you’ve ever noticed red bumps, black dots, or dirt on your cat’s chin, your cat may struggle with cat acne, or cat chin acne.  

At its basic definition, cat chin acne is a disease in which the hair follicles—typically the ones on a cat’s chin—produce too much keratin and become plugged up. This results in red bumps, blackheads, and infected pimple-like lesions.

Cats can have a single, isolated bout of cat acne, or it may be chronic.

Chronic or severely affected cats may have so many plugged follicles that they fuse together, and form swollen, painful crusts. As the lesions get bigger, the follicles are more prone to rupture, which is a sore and often messy experience. Cat acne can also lead to chronic hair loss in the affected area.

Felines of all ages can develop acne, since it’s not believed to be related to sex hormones. Additionally, cat acne affects males and females of all breeds, as well as both and neutered and unneutered cats.",ASC102
15,"Symptoms of Cat Acne
Symptoms of cat acne include:

Redness or swelling

Bumps and pustules

Scabs and crusts

Pain around the chin",ASC102
16,"Why are there black scabs on cat's chin? 
If you’re seeing chin sores or black scabs on cat's chin, your cat might have cat chin acne. Cat acne does not solely manifest itself on the chin – cat acne on lips is also something to look out for. If there are scabs under cat's chin, check with a vet.
What does feline acne look like?
Feline acne manifests itself as small bumps accompanied by blackheads or whiteheads, similar to humans. But on a cat’s skin it can often take an appearance that looks more like dirt than pimples, which is why many owners don’t even notice the skin condition. Severe cases can lead to hair loss, redness and even bleeding.
What causes cat acne?
The causes of cat chin acne are still largely a mystery. It’s thought to be caused by an over-production of keratin. However, lifestyle choices can encourage cat chin acne too:

Plastic bowls
It's been noticed in cats that use plastic bowls for food and water.

Poor grooming
This can lead to acne, especially in older cats.
 

These feline acne causes can be changed fairly easily. However, there are a series of underlying conditions that can have a contribution as well:

Poor immune system.
Stress.
Food allergies.
Hormone imbalances.
Hyperactive sebaceous glands.
 

If you’ve made the necessary lifestyle changes and suspect your cat’s acne is caused by an underlying issue, you’ll need to contact a vet.",ASC102
17,"Skin allergies (seasonal or to foods)
Contact hypersensitivity (typically to plastic)
Excessive scent marking
Stress
Viruses such as calicivirus and herpes virus
Poor grooming habits
There are also other diseases such as demodicosis (mange), ring worm and other types of allergic reactions that may appear similar to feline acne and should be ruled out by your veterinarian. Acne can affect cats of all breeds. While a genetic predisposition may exist, no direct link has yet demonstrated that this disease is an inherited condition.

Clinical Signs of Feline Acne
Acne in cats isn't always easy to spot. While even mild feline chin acne will readily stand out in cats with white or light-colored fur, it may not be so obvious in cats with darker coats. Normally, acne may appear as little black dots on the chin or lip margins. These comedones (blackheads) can appear bumpy, crusty or just dirty. Fur may be missing in these areas, and the affected skin may be raised and bumpy or swollen and reddened.

In more severely affected cats, the entire chin area or lip margins may be swollen, red and/or missing fur. Instead of tiny black dots, draining pustules over thickened skin are typically evident in these cats. Spots of blood may even be spied on their nearby fur or on objects they choose to rub against. If the acne is severe, these cats may paw at the area or rub vigorously against objects, but most appear unfazed by acne. It is not considered especially itchy or painful.",ASC102
18,"Cats with more severe forms of feline acne often have other skin issues to contend with. These can include other areas of hairlessness, redness or bumpy crusting. Excessive grooming or obvious itchiness is possible, too. Allergic skin disease is, after all, a major predisposing factor in cases of feline acne.",ASC102
19,"Although the exact cause of feline acne is unknown, some causes include:

Hyperactive sebaceous glands
Poor hygiene
Stress
Developing secondary to fungal, viral, and bacterial infections
Reaction to medication
Eating or drinking from plastic containers. While it has commonly been suggested that cats are ""allergic"" to these containers, recent research suggests that plastic containers harbour bacteria due to irregular surfaces.
Demodicosis or mange, causing itchiness and hair loss
Suppressed immune system
Hair follicles that don't function properly
Rubbing the chin (to display affection or mark territory) on non-sanitized household items
Hormonal imbalance
Obese cats which have difficulty grooming themselves are predisposed to dry, flaky skin and feline acne",ASC102
20,"Cat acne is most common on the chin or around the mouth, but it can be present anywhere on the body. Appearing as small bumps, it often looks similar to the blackheads or whiteheads that humans get. Some cats have a single breakout, while others have recurring symptoms. If the condition is severe, you may notice hair loss, redness, and even nodules or bleeding scabs. If your cat scratches or licks the affected area, a bacterial infection, which can be serious, may also develop. For this reason, it’s important to remember that you shouldn’t squeeze, pick at, or otherwise try to remove your cat’s pimples.",ASC102
21,"Does your cat look like she has some dirt on her chin? It could be feline acne, a common skin condition in cats. What looks like a dirty chin could be a mild to moderate case of cat acne. Those black specks are actually blackheads, similar to blackheads in humans. In more severe cases, a cat can develop red sores and lesions on the chin area.

Some cats are more prone to acne than others. This includes cats who don’t groom properly, produce excess sebum or keratin, have clogged hair follicles, or have allergies. Your veterinarian can perform a simple test to diagnose acne and rule out any other skin conditions.

Your vet may clean the area and clip the fur, and then apply a topical treatment to your cat’s chin. The treatment will continue at home, with continued application of the ointment. Hot compresses can also be helpful. If the acne has progressed to an infection, antibiotics may be required.",ASC102
22,"The chin is the most common location for acne in dogs and cats. Sometimes the acne can be seen around the lips and muzzle. It may appear red, brown, or black (like a blackhead), or it may look like pustules (pimples).",ASC102
23,"Certain diseases also increase the likelihood of feline acne. These include food and environmental allergies; eosinophilic granuloma complex; ringworm; infection with Demodex mites; autoimmune disorders such as pemphigus foliaceous; and contact hypersensitivity (e.g. skin sensitivity to certain materials or chemicals, such as the plastic used in some food bowls).
What Are the Signs of Feline Acne?

The skin on the cat’s chin will be thick, red, and crusty. Clogged hair follicles may be visible. These appear as dark lesions or spots under the skin containing thick material. In some cats, discharge or fluid may be seen on or around the chin. Chin acne is not typically itchy or painful unless the case is severe or the cat also has other infections or diseases.  Other clinical signs may come from any ongoing associated diseases. For example, areas of circular, crusty hair loss may be seen with ringworm, a fungal infection.",ASC102

61,"As hypertension is often seen as an effect of other diseases, cats with hypertension may be showing signs attributable to their underlying problem. For example, in the case of hyperthyroid cats with high blood pressure, weight loss (in spite of a voracious appetite) and hyperactivity may be the major clinical signs.

In many patients, no specific clinical signs of hypertension will be seen until the condition advances to the point where there is spontaneous bleeding into the eye or retinal detachment – these cats are often taken to a vet as they develop sudden onset blindness. Early recognition of hypertension is therefore important in order to minimise the severe and often permanently damaging effects of persistently high blood pressure on the eyes and other organs.

Some cats with hypertension appear depressed, lethargic and withdrawn, and many owners notice an improvement in their cat’s behaviour once hypertension has been successfully managed, even if signs of damage to other organs are not present. Severe headaches can occur in humans with hypertension, and it is likely that cats may suffer something similar.",ASC1022
62,"Visual abnormalities are the most common clinical findings with feline hypertension. These abnormalities can include dilated pupils that do not constrict with light, blood within the chamber of the eye, and blindness. Blindness develops because high blood pressure in the eye causes the retina to detach. Other possible indications of high blood pressure include restlessness, agitation, decreased grooming, changes in appetite, thirst and/or weight. These problems may be temporary or permanent, just like in people and only time can tell which ailments will resolve, and which will be long lasting.

However, the most common lesion diagnosed is exudative retinal detachment, with an increased risk when systolic blood pressure exceeds 180 mmHg. Other lesions, such as retinal hemorrhage, multifocal retinal edema, retinal vessel tortuosity, retinal perivascular edema, papillary edema, vitreous hemorrhage, secondary glaucoma, and retinal degeneration have all been observed.

67,"An early diagnosis is vital when dealing with high blood pressure in cats.

The only way to know your cat’s blood pressure is elevated is to have their blood pressure checked by a vet.

However, these are the signs you should be looking out for:

A frequent bleeding nose. If your cat begins bleeding from their nose you need to closely monitor the situation. A one-off nose bleed may just be an isolated incident and no cause for alarm. However, if the bleeds become more frequent, you will need to contact your vet. There are many causes of a bloody nose in cats including injury, upper respiratory infection and blood clotting, Elevated blood pressure brought on kidney disease is another. A full physical examination should get to the root cause. A cold compress to their face will help slow the bleeding.
Cats are extremely graceful creatures, so if you see one bumping into furniture, falling over often or even struggling to stand, you’ll know something isn’t quite right. High blood pressure can lead to disorientation in felines. You may notice them circling to one side. While we are able to feel when our balance is off or when we become a bit lightheaded, dizzy spells in cats cat be difficult to spot. Dizziness may also be a sign that your cat is suffering from low blood pressure.
Problems with vision are one of the most common symptoms associated with hypertension in cats. If untreated it can eventually lead to blindness due to high blood pressure in the eye causing retinal detachment. Sudden blindness is usually obvious to spot, but gradual sight loss needs a keener eye. Check for bleeding from the eyes, swelling or changes in color and appearance. If your cat has suddenly started bumping into objects, this could also be sign they are struggling with their eyesight. Some causes of blindness are reversible, so it’s important to contact your vet as soon as possible.
Low energy. Elevated blood pressure brought on by heart or kidney issues can leave cats feeling drained. While felines do enjoy plenty of sleep, once they’re up and about, they do tend to expend quite a bit of energy. Some cats with hypertension may become more withdrawn, lethargic or even appear depressed. Once treatment is started, and blood pressure begins to drop, you should notice your cat’s activity levels increase. It is worth noting that low blood pressure can also result in diminishing energy levels.
Trouble breathing. Shortness of breath can be a telltale sign of hypertension in cats. This could be exhibited through panting, fast breathing or difficulty breathing. A cat that is struggling to breathe will inevitably end up stressed and anxious, possibly resulting in a further rise in blood pressure. Do your best to calm them down. Keep them indoors, comfortable and cool. Anytime your cat is encountering breathing difficulties you should immediately contact your vet.
High blood pressure is often linked to seizures in cats. Seizures can take a number of forms including convulsions, leg paddling, loss of consciousness, tremors, incessant meowing or crying and loss of urinary or bowel control. They can be brief and some owners may not even notice them. Don’t touch your cat while they’re experiencing a seizure, only if there’s a chance they could sustain an injury. Seizures are not generally considered medical emergencies. If it stops after one or two minutes, book an appointment to see your vet as soon as possible. If the seizures are happening back-to-back, you should take them to the vet immediately.
A blatant change in demeanor or overall behavior. Your cat may not exhibit any of the physical symptoms related to high blood pressure until the condition is too severe. That’s why we need to make sure we monitor their general behavior closely. Have they suddenly become more aggressive? Are they refusing food? Have you noticed increased vocalization? As blood pressure rises, a cat’s heart rate is likely to follow suit. This may lead to them acting abnormally, so we need to be alert to any changes.",ASC1022
68,"Hypertension is the medical term for high blood pressure. In cats, hypertension usually develops as a secondary complication to other medical conditions, such as chronic kidney disease and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland). Less commonly, primary or essential hypertension (hypertension without any underlying disease) may also occur.

Effects of hypertension

Since hypertension is often associated with an underlying medical condition, cats may display clinical signs attributable to their underlying problem, such as increased thirst (chronic kidney disease) or weight loss (hyperthyroidism). In many cats, no specific clinical signs will be seen until the hypertension is quite advanced.

Hypertension typically results in damage to vulnerable organs, such as the eyes, brain and nervous system, heart and kidneys.

- Eyes: Bleeding into the eyes, retinal swelling and detachment, can occur resulting in often permanent blindness.

- Brain and nervous system: Bleeding into the brain or nervous system can result in neurological signs, such as altered behaviour, wobbly gait, head tilt, seizures, or even coma.

- Heart: Over time, the muscle of one of the heart chambers (the left ventricle) becomes thickened, which may in severe cases lead to the development of congestive heart failure. Affected cats may show signs of laboured breathing and lethargy.

- Kidneys: Over time, high blood pressure damages the filtering mechanism within the kidney and may increase the risk of developing kidney failure.

116,"How To Tell If Your Cat Has Asthma
There are a number of symptoms that are indicative of cat asthma, ranging from mild to severe. Your cat may show one or several of the following symptoms:

1. Heavy/rapid breathing
The normal rate of breathing for cats is about 25-30 breaths per minute at rest4. If you notice your cat is taking more than 40 breaths per minute (when not playing or excited)5, it may be an indication of asthma.

2. Fatigue/lethargy
You may notice your cat is lethargic after playing or is breathing heavier than usual after playtime. Lethargy in cats is a possible sign of low oxygen in the blood, which can result from constricted or swollen air passages6.

3. Breathing through the mouth
You may notice your cat is breathing through their mouth or panting.",ASC104
117,"Cat Asthma Attack Symptoms
In the event of an asthma attack, the following symptoms7 may be present:

1. Squatting position with neck extended
In an effort to get as much air as possible during an asthma attack, your cat may take a position with their neck extended upwards and their body low to the ground.

2. Blue lips and gums
When oxygen can’t make its way to the lungs, red blood cells can’t transport enough oxygen to the rest of the body. As a result, you may notice your cat’s lips and/or gum start to turn blue.

3. Wheezing
Your cat may be wheezing if they are having difficulty breathing. A wheeze is a whistling or rattling sound made when it is difficult for air to make its way through the air passageways. This is usually a sign the passageways are swollen and/or constricted.

4. Coughing/hacking
During an asthma attack, your cat may be coughing or hacking. A coughing cat sounds a bit different than a coughing human—it will sound like your cat is trying to pass a hairball.",ASC104
118,"Symptoms of Cat Asthma
Some cats have more severe asthma than others. Symptoms of asthma in cats include:

Difficulty breathing
Rapid breathing
Wheezing
Coughing or hacking
Vomiting
Chronic coughing
Weakness
Lethargy
Your cat may also squat with hunched shoulders and neck extended and cough or breathe rapidly. Sometimes people assume their cat is hacking up a hairball. ",ASC104
119,"Causes of Cat Asthma
There may be other factors, but allergies are thought to be the main cause of cat asthma. It’s an inflammatory response to allergens. If a cat or kitten is sensitive to certain allergens, the immune system may release chemicals that cause inflammation in the airways. The airways become irritated and tighten and cause difficulty breathing.

Allergens can also irritate the lining of cats’ airways, which causes bronchitis and mucus production. This can lead to coughing and sometimes to airway obstruction. ",ASC104
120,"Management of the acute and the chronic asthmatic feline patient must be addressed using a multi-modal, anti-inflammatory approach. Asthma in cats is an inflammatory condition of the lower airways that manifests clinically as a chronic cough and, in some cases, intermittent exacerbations with expiratory distress (Read more about upper airway conditions). Airway inflammation is typically eosinophilic, but a neutrophilic component can be seen in severely asthmatic patients, particularly if a secondary bacterial infection is present. Eosinophilic airway inflammation is not specific for feline asthma, and during initial diagnostic work-up, other differential diagnoses, including parasitic bronchitis (e.g., lungworms, heartworm-associated respiratory disease) should be considered.

Bronchoconstriction is a key feature of feline asthma that results in increased airway resistance. This manifests as wheezes on thoracic auscultation and increased respiratory effort most noticeable on exhalation. This may also be accompanied by increased abdominal effort, known as an “abdominal push.” Increased mucus production is also a prominent feature of asthma in cats, and this may contribute to airway narrowing and increased respiratory effort.",ASC104

126,"The most likely symptom that you will notice if your cat develops asthma is a cough. It may also have an increased breathing rate or difficulty breathing. The severity of signs is highly variable between pets, and variable over time. Some cats may even require immediate medical attention for a sudden onset of open mouth breathing, increased breathing rate, or increased breathing effort. Most commonly, your cat may have intermittent cough but appear normal between episodes. Coughing can be difficult to notice in cats and is often mistaken for hacking up hairballs. Your veterinarian may notice that your cat has an increased breathing rate and wheezes when it exhales. The inconsistency in signs makes diagnosis of asthma nearly impossible without taking into account your cat’s history, along with examination and diagnostic test findings.",ASC104
127,"First, excess mucus forms in the airways. After that, the airway walls swell with inflammation and can actually ulcerate. Finally, the airway muscles go into spasms leading to constriction. Airway constriction leads to an inability to draw a deep breath, intolerance to exercise, coughing, and musical sighing sounds called “wheezes,” though not all these symptoms may be apparent at the same time.

Sometimes a low-grade chronic cough is the only evident sign, but it should be remembered that a sudden asthmatic crisis can arise at any time and can represent a life-threatening event. Asthmatic airway constriction can happen spontaneously, in reaction to stress or anxiety, or as a type of allergic reaction. Relieving and preventing airway constriction is the main focus of treatment.",ASC104
128,"Barney was none too happy to be at the office. His plans for the day had clearly revolved around eating some cat food, curling up in the sun by the window, and then going back for some more cat food later. Unfortunately for him he had been periodically hacking for the past four days, and his owner was getting tired of racing across the house to hold a newspaper under his chin in an attempt to catch the hairball that he was apparently trying to bring up. So far no hairball had actually been produced, but the cat was still hacking.

“Trying to hack up a hairball” is the most common description I hear for cats who are actually suffering from asthma. When you awaken in the morning to your cat going hack, hack, hack, GAAAAAK it is natural to think that the problem is gastrointestinal, but if at the end of the performance your cat has not left you a slimy puddle to step in on your way to the bathroom it may be that lung disease is actually his problem.

In cats asthma tends to have a waxing and waning course at first. They may cough for a few days, and then seem to get over it without any intervention at all. Eventually the episodes start coming closer and closer together until the coughing and wheezing becomes continual. The problem with leaving asthmatic episodes untreated is that even though they initially seem to resolve on their own, there is permanent damage being done to the lungs each time. As that damage accumulates with each attack the cat is left with less and less functional lung tissue. It is not unusual to have a cat present at thirteen years of age in extreme respiratory distress and find that the lungs are so scarred from years of untreated asthma that there is nothing left to work with. At that point the prognosis is poor. If we can catch them earlier, however, we can often prevent this outcome.",ASC104

131,"Diagnosing Asthmatic Cats
Feline asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to difficulty in breathing that makes daily activities difficult to accomplish.

“Most cats are young adults — between 3 and 4 years old — when diagnosed with asthma, but it can affect cats of any age,” Cook said. “Cats with asthma tend to be limited in their ability to play and climb, as they can become short of breath and exertion makes them feel worse. Affected cats may even hide or isolate themselves.”

Cook pointed out that wheezing is often a strong indication of asthma, but there are also other signs that can be used to help make a diagnosis.

“Signs include increased breathing effort and rate, breathing with an open mouth, and coughing,” Cook said. ”Because most of the signs are less specific, testing is needed to confirm a diagnosis.”

Other conditions can mimic asthma symptoms, which is why a formal diagnosis by a veterinarian is necessary to determine the true underlying cause. This ensures that the cat receives the most appropriate treatment.

“Those signs are not specific to asthma and can also be seen in cats with respiratory infections, heartworm disease, heart failure, or cancer,” Cook said. “All of these conditions are serious, so it is very important to seek veterinary care quickly for any cat that experiences changes in breathing patterns.”",ASC104
132,"What are the signs?

A component of feline atopic syndrome, feline asthma appears to be triggered predominantly by aeroallergens. Common symptoms include coughing and wheezing, dyspnea (rapid open-mouth breathing), and possibly severe bronchoconstriction. Animals may produce excess mucus that can cause coughing and wheezing fits. Affected animals may have a moderate increase in total serum IgE levels (see Fig. 20.2). However, investigations into cats with airway eosinophilia found that some possessed IgE antibodies to respiratory aeroallergens, especially house dust mites. However, the percentage of positive animals did not differ significantly from healthy control cats. More research is required on this topic.",ASC104

176,"What are the symptoms of kennel cough?
The main symptom is the cough, which is often described as a ‘hacking cough’. It may sound like your dog is trying to clear something stuck in their throat or retching. Occasionally they may also cough up frothy white phlegm.

Some dogs will also have a runny nose, eye discharge and be a bit sneezy.

The symptoms of kennel cough typically take up to 14 days to develop and can then last between one and three weeks.

Although most dogs don’t appear to be very unwell and will recover well within a few weeks, you should always talk to your vet if the cough persists or if your dog also has:

A reduced appetite
Less energy than normal
A high temperature
In a healthy adult dog kennel cough may be nothing more than a nuisance as your dog will be eating normally and generally in good health. However, there are different strains of kennel cough and some can be worse than others, and many more serious diseases, such as lung cancers, pneumonia or heart failure will also have a similar cough as the major symptom.

In elderly or unwell dogs and puppies the condition can sometimes be more serious and  develop into pneumonia. If you’re worried about your dog, please always contact your vet immediately.",ASC1088
177,"How do I know if my dog has kennel cough?
The main symptom is a non-productive persistent dry cough that can sound somewhat like a goose honk or as if your pup has something stuck in their throat. Other signs of kennel cough in dogs can include runny nose, sneezing, lack of energy, decreased appetite and mild fever.

If your dog is showing signs of kennel cough keep your pet away from other dogs and contact your vet right away for advice.

Because of the incredibly contagious nature of the condition, if your dog is otherwise healthy, and showing mild symptoms, your vet may recommend simply isolating your pet from other dogs and allowing your pup to rest for a few days as you monitor their symptoms. 

That said, if your pup's symptoms are more severe your vet may recommend bringing your pet in for an examination.",ASC1088
178,"The incubation period is between two and 10 days for dogs with kennel cough, according to Krafchik. The most common symptom of kennel cough is as the name suggests; a loud cough that sounds like hacking or honking.

Additional symptoms include:

Coughing
Sneezing
Runny nose
Loss of appetite
Decreased energy level
Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the membrane lining the eyelids)
Hacking
Wheezing
Depressed behavior
“If your dog has nasal discharge, is breathing rapidly, refuses to eat or seems lethargic, take them back to the veterinarian right away. Serious cases of kennel cough can lead to pneumonia if left untreated,” Krafchik says.",ASC1088
179,"Canine cough, also known as canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC), and previously referred to as kennel cough, is a common, infectious upper respiratory disease seen in dogs. It is not a serious disease in most otherwise healthy dogs. However, it is very contagious and will spread rapidly among a population of dogs. As the name suggests, it causes coughing that can last up to several weeks in some cases.

Canine cough is transmitted through dog-to-dog contact by sniffing and coughing, sharing of food and water bowls, and toys. The time from exposure to coughing can be 2 to 14 days. Dogs in kennels, doggie day-care, training classes, group dog walks or those that spend time at parks and beaches where dogs socialise may have an increased risk of exposure.

The disease is characterised by a harsh, hacking cough that most people describe like “something stuck in my dog’s throat” or a “goose honk.” Your dog may appear to be retching and swallowing, and the cough can be productive, often with the production of foamy mucus (which may be confused with vomiting). Dogs may develop a discharge from their nose or eyes.

An uncomplicated case of canine cough runs a course of a week or two with frequent episodes of coughing, often made worse by barking, exercise or excitement. Most dogs maintain normal energy levels and appetite. Complicated cases may become lethargic, have reduced or loss of appetite and develop a fever. If you are concerned about your dog, you should seek advice from your veterinarian.",ASC1088
180,"Kennel cough is considered to be a common and contagious canine ailment. Owners have described it as sounding as if something is stuck in their dog’s throat. Kennel cough can be compared to a chest cold in humans—and there are times you may need to seek veterinary treatment.

Here are six things to know about kennel cough:
Kennel cough (infectious tracheobronchitis) is a contagious respiratory tract infection caused by the bacteria Bordetella bronchiseptica. Concurrent viral and/or bacterial infections may be present as well.
After your dog is exposed, he/she may develop infection of the nasal passages and respiratory tract, typically leading to the development of a deep, hoarse cough. Oftentimes, there may be a productive retch (white foamy fluid) associated with the end of the coughing episode.
Kennel cough is usually mild. Your dog may continue with normal activities; the disease will generally run its course and improve within a few weeks.
More severe cases could last longer and should be treated by your family veterinarian. Look for fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite as additional symptoms that indicate a more severe case.
Some dogs may require treatment with antimicrobials and cough suppressants. A small proportion of dogs may develop bacterial pneumonia and require more extensive hospitalization and treatment.
Vaccination is very effective to either prevent the disease or lessen the severity of the clinical signs. The immunity to vaccination is short-lived therefore booster immunization is required to maintain a protective benefit.",ASC1088

182,"The most common symptom of kennel cough is a cough that sounds a little like a goose or that your dog has something stuck in their throat. Other symptoms of kennel cough in dogs could include a lack of energy, a mild fever, sneezing, a runny nose, and a lack of appetite.

Any dogs showing the symptoms of kennel cough should be isolated and you should call your vet to determine the next steps.

This condition is incredibly contagious. If your pooch is otherwise healthy and only exhibiting mild symptoms, your vet may suggest keeping them isolated from other pets and providing your pet with several days' rest as you keep an eye on their symptoms.

Although, if your dog has more severe symptoms your vet might ask you to bring them into the office so they can be examined.",ASC1088

Castration (being neutered)

Glucocorticoid (steroid) therapy

Certain medical conditions may also predispose a cat to developing diabetes.

Most Common Signs of Diabetes Mellitus in Cats 
If left untreated, diabetes mellitus can progress to a stage of the disease that is life-threatening for cats. So it’s important for you to know the symptoms of diabetes in cats, and to contact your veterinarian right away if you believe that your cat may be experiencing any of them.

Increased thirst

Increase in frequency and volume of urination

Urinating outside the litter box

Increased appetite

Weight loss (despite a hearty appetite)

Vomiting

Muscle wasting

Lethargy or weakness

Poor coat quality (oily coat, dandruff)

Plantigrade stance (less common)

In cases of uncontrolled diabetes, cats may develop damage to the nerves in their hind limbs, which causes a plantigrade stance.

Common signs include long-lasting or recurrent diarrhoea, a runny nose and sneezing (rhinitis), inflammations of the eye and recurrent skin infections. They are also more likely to get some types of cancer.",ASC231
267,"FIV Symptoms
Although there are no specific symptoms associated with FIV in cats, signs may include:

Weight loss
Lethargy
Fever
Gingivitis and stomatitis (inflammation of the gums and mouth)
Enlarged lymph nodes
Chronic or recurrent intestinal, respiratory, ocular or skin disease
Neurological disease (in some cats the virus can affect the brain)",ASC231
268,"What are the Symptoms of FIV
Signs that a cat has FIV can include:

Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Poor coat condition
Persistent fever
Inflammation of the gums and mouth
Skin, urinary, intestinal, or upper respiratory tract infections
Persistent diarrhea
Seizures, behavior changes, and other neurological disorders
A variety of eye conditions
It is important to note that many of these symptoms may not be related to FIV at all.",ASC231
269,"FIV usually causes disease through immunosuppression – the normal immune responses of the cat are compromised, leading to an increased susceptibility to other infections and diseases. There are no specific signs associated with FIV, but typically infected cats will develop recurrent bouts of infections or diseases that gradually get worse over time, and infections may not respond to treatment as well as would normally be expected.

Some of the most common signs seen in FIV infected cats are:

Weight loss
Recurrent fever
Lethargy
Enlarged lymph nodes
Gingivitis and stomatitis (inflammation of the gums and mouth)
Chronic or recurrent respiratory, ocular and intestinal disease
Chronic skin disease
Neurological disease (in some cats the virus can affect the brain)

Symptoms of anemia include some—or all the following:

Lethargy 

Pale gums (sometimes the gums are yellow, indicating jaundice)

Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing

Increased heart rate

Weakness or collapse

Decreased appetite

Causes of Anemia in Cats
Anemia isn’t a disease itself but rather secondary to diseases or conditions in the body that cause anemia. The causes of anemia can be broken down into three broad categories. This includes blood loss, destruction of RBCs, and a failure to produce new RBCs.  

Blood loss can be internal (inside the body), external (outside the body), or both. Some common causes of blood loss in cats include:

Trauma, such as being hit by car

Fleas/ticks that suck blood from the body—this can be significant in newborn kittens

Hookworm infestations that feed on the blood in the intestines

Bleeding tumors 

Severe stomach ulcers 

Diseases that prevent proper blood clotting such as hemophilia

Anticoagulant rodenticide toxicity (when a cat ingests rat poison that prevents blood clotting, leading to bleeding)

Post-surgical complications, such as a suture on a blood vessel coming undone or breaking",ASC26

The symptoms of low blood sugar in cats, even in the warning stage, are easy to detect and often unsettling to cat owners. A cat with hypoglycemia is quickly losing brain power, resulting in neurologic disorders and an increased appetite as the body relies on food consumption for an energy supply. Depending on how low the feline’s blood sugar levels have dropped, symptoms could be mild to severe.

413,"Arthritis, also known as osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease, is a term that refers to inflammation of the joints. It occurs when there is degeneration of the smooth cartilage lining in the joints and can affect dogs of any age. Risk factors include (but are not limited to) size, old age, obesity, pre-existing orthopaedic issues (e.g., hip or elbow dysplasia) or any history of joint trauma. Arthritis can be extremely debilitating and make normal behaviour such as standing, walking and playing very painful.

As a result, dogs with arthritis may be reluctant to engage in activities they used to enjoy and may struggle to move about the house and garden. Rather than excuse this as just an inevitable part of ageing, there is now a lot that can be done to help manage this disease. If you think your dog may have arthritis, seek help from your vet – the sooner the better!",ASC34
414,"Dogs can’t tell us they’re in pain with words, so it’s up to us to watch for the signs and symptoms of arthritis. Early signs of arthritis can be subtle, so keep note of any of these changes and make an appointment for a check-up with your vet:

Stiffness rising after rest.
Reluctance to walk, run or play.
Difficulty climbing stairs or jumping into the car.
Limping and reduced mobility.
Pain when affected joints are touched.
Behavioural changes – seeming less willing to interact or play, licking at their toes or other joints.",ASC34
415,"What is arthritis?
Arthritis is an inflammation of the joints and is a common problem for many dogs, causing pain, discomfort and stiffness. In dogs with arthritis, cartilage within a joint (hip, elbow etc.) changes or becomes damaged, making it less smooth and causing the bones in the joint to rub together. This rubbing can be uncomfortable or painful and can damage to cartilage even more. As a direct result of this increased friction, new bone forms around the joint, making it stiffer and more difficult to move (known as degenerative joint disease).

What causes arthritis?
Arthritis is usually a problem in older dogs, but the condition can develop from an early age due to problems with bone and joint development. Depending on the cause, arthritis may affect one joint, or any number of your dog's joints. Most cases develop as a result of abnormal rubbing within the joint caused by:

joint instability (e.g. after ligament damage)
damage to or abnormal cartilage development
damage caused by trauma (e.g. fractures)
What are the signs that my dog has arthritis?
Reluctance to exercise 
Lameness or stiffness (especially after long periods of rest)
Worsening signs when cold or damp
Licking at joint (signs of saliva staining)
Your dog appearing slower than usual
Your dog being grumpy",ASC34
416,"Arthritis (also called degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis) is a chronic, painful, progressive condition involving the joints of cats. As in people, this is commonly associated with aging, and likely impacts between 70% and 90% of cats over 12 years old.",ASC34
417,"At what age do cats develop arthritis?
According to Cats Protection, more than 80% of cats over the age of 10 suffer from arthritis, but it often goes undiagnosed. This common problem refers to inflammation of their joints, causing pain, discomfort and stiffness.

Inside their joints, the surface of the bone is usually covered with a thin layer of smooth cartilage and lubricated with a small amount of fluid, which allows the joint to move freely and without friction.

Arthritis occurs when the joint is damaged or its naturally smooth surface changes, resulting in the rough bone rubbing together. Not only is this very painful for your cat, but it also further damages the cartilage and causes new bone to form around the joint, making it stiffer and limiting movement. This is called osteoarthritis, or degenerative joint disease.",ASC34
418,"Arthritis is a progressive disease and symptoms develop and worsen over time. However, cats are very good at hiding symptoms of pain so it can be difficult to identify. You may notice that your cat becomes reluctant to play or use stairs. They may avoid jumping up or down from high ledges that previously wouldn’t pose a problem for them.

The condition becomes worse in cold weather, so if they appear stiff or slow during the winter months, this could be a sign of arthritis.

Other symptoms include:

Reduced movement
Reduced grooming with matting in hard-to-reach areas
Irritability and a change in attitude
Less activity (for example, bringing you fewer ‘presents’ indicates their inability to hunt)
Toileting outside of the litter tray
If you think your cat may be showing signs of arthritis, speak to your vet for a complete health check and advice. They may recommend further x-rays or other scans to diagnose the condition.",ASC34
419,"We often miss signs of arthritis in our kitties at home.  Cats hide arthritis very well.  They tend to restrict their own activity when joint pain is present.  Instead of missing a jump, they will often simply not even try to jump.  Instead of limping, they’ll just stay still.  These are “absence symptoms,” and are much tougher to notice than “presence symptoms.”  Even when we do notice our kitties being less active, we often attribute that to “old age,” when in fact there may be a treatable cause such as arthritis or other chronic illness.

“Absence symptoms”
“Absence symptoms” are symptoms that are often not obvious. These behaviors are decreased or not present, rather than new, abnormal behaviors.  Some absence symptoms of feline arthritis are:  Some absence symptoms of feline arthritis are:  

NOT jumping as high as before
NOT attempting to jump at all
NOT running or playing as much 
NOT grooming as well (or at all in advanced cases), or
NOT jumping up or down without using intermediate objects as “stairs.”",ASC34
420,"“Presence Symptoms”
“Presence symptoms” are symptoms that involve showing a behavior that was not previously present.  Arthritic cats may show presence symptoms, which are often very subtle and easy to miss if we aren’t aware of exactly what to look for.

False Starts: A common “presence symptom” of feline arthritis is “feinting” before jumping up. A healthy cat will aim for a spot and jump straight to it.  An arthritic cat, especially with hip arthritis, may bob up and down a couple of times, making several “false starts” before taking the jump.  It is a very subtle behavior change; you must be looking for it to see it.
The Front Leg Pullup: This is often seen when arthritis is affecting the hips, so that the kitty can accomplish some upward jumping, but perhaps not as far up as he wants to go.  He will then muscle himself the rest of the way up using his shoulders and front legs.
Walking Down: Another common sign is “walking down” vertical surfaces as a prelude to jumping down.  You may see this if your cat is jumping down from a counter or a desk, where a vertical surface is available.  Rather than jumping straight from the elevated surface to the floor, a cat with feline arthritis may place his front paws on the vertical surface first, taking a couple of small steps down before taking the actual jump.  “Walking down” is often associated with elbow arthritis.
The Staircase Bunny Hop: When going up or down stairs, arthritic cats will often take the stairs one at a time, bringing both back legs together up or down to the next step.
The Hunchback: Arthritic cats will often keep their hips tucked under and their heads lowered, creating a hunchbacked posture.  This develops very slowly, and may only be obvious if the current posture is compared to older photos of your cat.
Asking to be Lifted: Many arthritic cats will begin to ask to be lifted up onto a bed or sofa to be with you, rather than making the jump.
Increasingly Sedentary Behavior: Normal cats spend a large portion of every day sleeping, but arthritic cats may remain unmoving even in the face of activity triggers, such as you returning home from work.
Urinating or Defecating Outside the Litterbox: It can be uncomfortable for an arthritic cat to get into the litterbox, or to maneuver herself inside the box.  Many cats with this particular issue will urinate or defecate right next to the box.  This may be a signal that your kitty is trying to do it right but just can’t!
Increased Grumpiness: This can result from any chronic illness, but is certainly a common symptom of arthritis in cats.
Petting Avoidance: Avoidance behaviors can range from just wincing or pulling away when touched, all the way through attacking someone who attempts to pet a sore spot.  Avoidance can also be seen if the petter is attempting to extend or flex an arthritic joint, particularly the neck.",ASC34
421,"How Your Cat Vet Will Diagnose Feline Arthritis
Examination:  When examining your cat, your feline veterinarian will palpate various joints, and assess suspect joints for range of motion (percentage of full flexion and extension).  Evidence of pain when a joint is palpated or moved may be a sign of arthritis, as may decreased range of motion.
Mobility Assessment:  Your cat vet may want to observe your cat’s ability to walk on both horizontal and sloping surfaces, and to jump up or down.  At the hospital, some cats may refuse to walk at all, preferring to freeze in place; or if a cat is a little stressed and the disorder is not very advanced, all symptoms may disappear entirely at the vet, only to reappear at home after the adrenaline wears off.  Because this is so common, your doctor may ask you to provide some videos of your cat attempting these activities at home.
Radiographs:  Radiographs can be very helpful in the diagnosis of advanced arthritis, but are not always helpful or necessary.  Arthritis can be present and significant for a long period of time before any radiographic abnormalities are visible. 
Response to Treatment:  Assessing response to treatment is an important aid in diagnosis.  Your cat vet may prescribe any of a variety of therapies and request you to report back on any changes you see. 
In most cases, the diagnosis will be made based on joint pain, decreased range of motion, the cat’s age, any descriptions you can provide of the subtle signs listed above, and any demonstration of impaired mobility in the exam room.  Other disorders that may cause similar signs will need to be ruled out.",ASC34
422,"Arthritis is a condition that occurs as their joints naturally age and the cartilage material between the bones deteriorates and reduces in flexibility. This causes the bones in their joints to rub together, resulting in stiffness and pain. Arthritis in cats is quite common and according to Cats Protection, around 80% of cats over the age of 10 have some form of the disease.",ASC34
423,"Cats that suffer from joint problems such as arthritis (also known as degenerative joint disease or DJD) can exhibit symptoms of lameness, and may have difficulty in climbing or jumping onto furniture, grooming themselves or accessing the litter tray.

There are four main symptoms of cat arthritis to look out for:

Changing how they move:
Your cat may be more hesitant in their movements, and less likely to jump onto furniture that is out of reach.
They may even experience difficulty in climbing or descending stairs.
Your cat may exhibit tiredness or a lack of interest in exercise.
Cat arthritis can cause stiffness in the legs. Watch your cat moving after they wake up, as signs of stiffness or lameness may be more evident after a long period of inactivity.
Being less active:
As a result of cat arthritis, your cat will probably rest and sleep much more. They might also lie down in different areas that are easier to access.
Your cat may also be less inclined to play or explore as cat arthritis makes it more difficult to move.
A change of grooming habits
Your cat may groom less as a result of cat arthritis. This can result in a dirty or unkempt coat that might appear matted.
Your cat may focus on grooming areas that are in pain, such as excessively grooming over a particular joint. This could even lead to hair loss over that joint.
Mood changes
If your cat exhibits irritation at being handled where previously they enjoyed close contact then this could be a sign of cat arthritis.
Your cat may seek to spend more time alone, avoiding meeting people or other animals.
 

Diagnosis of cat arthritis
If your cat demonstrates any of the above symptoms, it’s a good idea to take them to the vet to be diagnosed. Your vet will conduct a thorough clinical examination to check for cat arthritis, which involves moving the joint to check for any stiffness, pain and grating.",ASC34
424,"It is common for veterinarians to expect clinical signs of disease seen in one species to be similar to those exhibited in another. Because of the high prevalence of osteoarthritis in dogs, the signs of canine osteoarthritis are familiar, and it is tempting to look for the same signs in cats. However, the clinical signs of feline osteoarthritis are vastly different due to cats’ ability to mask injury, and many are difficult to recognize because they are not acute. For example, while limping or stiffness are the typical clinical signs recognized by owners that provide clues to the presence of arthritis in dogs, these signs seem to be considerably less common in cats unless arthritic changes are more advanced or an acute flare-up of pain occurs.

In cats, the clinical signs of osteoarthritis are more typically behavioral changes.7 Behaviors that have historically been thought of by owners as “normal aging” changes in cats are now acknowledged as potential signs of underlying osteoarthritis (BOX 1).9 Decreased activity and reluctance to jump up (on household furniture or when outdoors) are signs that are now well recognized as sequelae of arthritic changes. Reluctance to play or to chase toys and other pets is also considered a change possibly associated with chronic arthritis.",ASC34

Cats are natural athletes and love to jump and climb and be in high spaces. When a cat stops jumping that is a sign that something is going on. The most common reason cats stop jumping is joint pain due to arthritis.

Arthritis is very common in older cats, we just don’t tend to recognize the signs. Cats don’t tend to limp or cry when they are experiencing joint pain, they just stop jumping and climbing, and they sleep more.

568,"The most common cause of acute gastroenteritis in dogs of all ages is dietary indiscretion – the tendency of dogs to eat without discrimination. This could include table scraps, garbage, toys, clothes, cat poop and organic material, to name just a few. The consequences may be mild if the substance passes without much issue or significant if the substance is toxic, irritating or large enough to block the intestines.

Less obvious causes of acute gastroenteritis may also include a food protein intolerance, especially with recent diet changes, the introduction of a new treat or some infectious/parasitic causes.

Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS), previously known as hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE), is a common cause of acute, onset, severe bloody diarrhea in adult dogs and has been linked to Clostridial bacterial infections. Viral infections (such as parvovirus and distemper in puppies), parasites, protozoal or bacterial causes can occur in any age group depending on exposure, vaccine status and deworming history.

Because vomiting and diarrhea can be non-specific secondary signs of systemic disease, other organ systems that may be involved include:

Acute pancreatitis
Acute liver or kidney injury
Hypoadrenocorticism (Addison’s disease)
Complications from diabetes
Restricted blood flow to the bowel",ASC965
569,"Pets with one or two episodes of vomiting or diarrhea but otherwise feel okay and are eating and drinking normally may have self-limiting gastroenteritis that will resolve on its own. However, if they have extended bouts of vomiting or regurgitation, can’t keep down food or water, have no interest in drinking or eating, or are in pain, you should seek urgent veterinary care with your primary veterinarian or at an emergency veterinary hospital.

A thorough physical exam by a veterinarian can detect signs of dehydration, abdominal pain, fever and signs of severe fluid loss causing hypovolemic shock (when blood plasma levels are too low).",ASC965
570,"Gastroenteritis has many faces. It can present as diarrhea alone (anywhere from mildly soft stool to watery feces) or diarrhea with vomiting. Less often, it can manifest as vomiting alone, though if the condition is confined to the stomach itself, veterinarians may refer to it as gastritis.

Gastroenteritis is further separated into two types — acute and chronic. Acute gastroenteritis comes on suddenly. Chronic gastroenteritis occurs over the course of weeks, months or even years. Acute gastroenteritis usually goes away by itself; in other cases, it will progressively worsen until veterinary treatment is provided.

Causes of Gastroenteritis in Dogs
Gastroenteritis in dogs can have many potential causes. Anything that alters a dog's microbiome significantly can lead to the condition. Here's a list of possible causes:

Ingestion of spoiled or raw foods, or of non-food items
Viruses (parvovirus, distemper, etc.)
Intestinal parasites
Changes in intestinal flora
A food allergy or sensitivity
Gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers
GI cancers
Foreign bodies
Intestinal obstruction
Genetic disease or predisposition
Unfortunately, it's usually difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the condition. However, this doesn't mean that your dog can't be cured. In fact, most veterinary treatment is successful.",ASC965
571,"Causes of gastroenteritis in dogs
Canine gastroenteritis is a non-specific symptom, which means that it can have many different causes. Some causes of gastroenteritis in dogs are shown below:

Dietary indiscretion – Scavenging from bins or from the floor; chewing or eating unsuitable food, animal remains, or non-food items.
Infectious causes – These can be transmitted directly from one dog to another, often through contact with infected dogs’ faeces, or they can gain entry to your dog’s body via contaminated food or water. 
Toxins – These may be found in plant material, cleaning products or garden chemicals, for example. They may also have been produced by microorganisms, such as bacteria, and lead to contamination of foodstuffs. Occasionally, dogs gain access to specific, known poisons.
Other diseases – Some diseases and conditions can cause gastroenteritis, as well as other symptoms. Endocrine conditions (for instance, Addison’s disease), kidney or liver disease, some types of cancer, and pyometra (where a female dog’s uterus fills with infected pus) all have the potential to cause gastroenteritis.
Medicines – Gastroenteritis can sometimes be an adverse effect of the use of certain drugs and medications. Occasionally, drugs that are considered relatively safe can cause gastroenteritis in individual dogs.
Events within the abdomen – Sometimes, structures within a dog’s body move out of their normal position and this can lead to gastroenteritis and life-threatening complications.

Symptoms of gastroenteritis in dogs
Vomiting – If symptoms are mild, you may only notice that your dog vomits once or twice and perhaps has mild diarrhoea the following day. Conversely, if your dog is more severely affected, they may vomit so much that they are unable to keep even water down, they may retch on an empty stomach, they may bring up yellow or greenish bile or bloody mucus or saliva and they may look very sorry for themselves. If a dog develops haemorrhagic gastroenteritis, they may vomit up pools of blood. 
Diarrhoea - If your dog’s diarrhoea is mild, all you may notice is that they need to go to the toilet more frequently than usual and they may need to get up during the night. Their faeces may be a little softer than they normally are and there may be clear mucus or sometimes, feint swirls of fresh blood on the surface. Depending upon which bit of the intestine has been affected, your dog may produce profuse or explosive, watery diarrhoea. Again, this may contain varying amounts of fresh blood. In serious infections, such as canine parvovirus, there may be small, whitish, solid lumps in the diarrhoea. These are patches of the intestinal lining, that have died and been sloughed off and passed along with the faeces.
Loud borborygmi – As well as vomiting and diarrhoea, you may hear gurgling or squeaking sounds coming from your dog’s abdomen. These sounds are borborygmi. In a dog who has an upset tummy, there may be an increase in intestinal movement or perhaps gut cramps, and the gut contents may be more liquid than usual and mixed with gas. When the intestines contract, they squeeze the contents along and you can sometimes hear this occurring. 
Painful abdomen – A dog with gastroenteritis almost certainly will have a tender or painful abdomen and you may notice this if you go to pick them up or touch their tummy. 
Mild fever and lethargy – Dogs with gastroenteritis are often lethargic and, if their temperature were to be checked, many of them would have a mild fever. 
If an otherwise healthy, adult dog with mild gastroenteritis signs is bright and is drinking at least their usual volume (even if they’re temporarily off their food) and you can’t see fresh blood or anything resembling coffee grounds in their vomit or diarrhoea, they’ll often recover within 24 to 48 hours with symptomatic treatment. Adult dogs normally have enough reserves to go without their usual food intake for a couple of days. Contact your vet team as soon as you suspect your dog may have gastroenteritis and they’ll be able to advise you on the best course of action for your dog.

Dogs whose symptoms are more severe, or lasting longer than 24-48 hours, may begin to develop secondary complications, such a hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Dehydration can happen very quickly in dogs who are vomiting or have diarrhoea but who are unable to keep fluids down or who feel too nauseous to drink.

If your dog has been showing any signs of gastroenteritis and seems to be getting weaker, more lethargic, or worse in any way, or if they’re not getting better, it’s important to speak urgently to your vet team for advice.",ASC965

Ingesting foreign bodies
Ingesting toxins
Certain viruses or bacteria, such as parvovirus
Liver and kidney disease
Intestinal parasites, such as worms
Food allergies
Gastrointestinal ulcers
Certain cancers of the gastrointestinal tract

573,"Gastroenteritis literally means ‘inflammation of the stomach and intestines’. As a dog’s stomach is delicate and very responsive to bacteria and toxins, gastroenteritis in dogs is a relatively common condition (1). It usually causes vomiting, diarrhoea and stomach pains in dogs as well as dry heaving and lethargy - though not necessarily all of those things.

 

There are different severities of gastroenteritis, so it pays to be vigilant when noticing unusual bowel movements or ‘off’ behaviour in your dog. Though common gastroenteritis is treatable and usually passes quickly, there are other more aggressive forms to look out for - and sometimes, gastroenteritis can be a symptom of something else.",ASC965
574,"Symptoms of gastroenteritis in dogs
 

If your pup has gastroenteritis, they could display all or one of the following symptoms…

Diarrhoea
The most common sign of gastroenteritis in dogs is soft stools - often starting with a poop that appears softer than usual, then becomes more watery and mucusy with each bowel movement. Sometimes, your dog may appear well, but has uncharacteristically pooped in the house. These toilet issues could be the only symptom of gastroenteritis that your dog shows.

Vomiting
If your poor pooch is being sick regularly, with or without accompanying diarrhoea, this is a clear indicator to take him to the vets. Without diarrhoea, they could have gastritis (inflammation of the stomach), which still needs to be treated.

Blood in stools
Pay attention if your dog’s poop has signs of blood in it, as bloody diarrhoea in dogs could be a symptom of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE). Don’t panic - HGE in dogs is treatable, but is a much rarer and more severe version of the condition, so should be responded to with emergency vet care.

Stomach pains
If your pooch whimpers or shows signs of discomfort when you touch them around the stomach and hind legs, they could have tummy pains due to gastroenteritis.

Loss of appetite
One of the less obvious signs of gastroenteritis in dogs is if your pup is off at meal times, especially if they’re usually hyper at the mere sight of the dog food spoon.

 

If your dog comes down with any of the above symptoms very suddenly, it’s essential that they see a vet as a matter of urgency. In severe cases gastroenteritis can be fatal, with younger dogs being most at risk.",ASC965
575,"SYMPTOMS
Gastroenteritis is a nonspecific term to describe an inflammation of the digestive tract (gut or stomach/intestine) and is often characterised by a sudden onset of vomiting and diarrhoea. If the problem is limited to vomiting, it may be termed gastritis, and if only diarrhoea, enteritis.

Uncomplicated gastroenteritis is often caused by eating spoiled or contaminated food, and dogs are more likely to be affected due to their tendency to scavenge. Frequently the real cause of the gastroenteritis remains unknown and the majority of pets will be treated successfully with symptomatic and supportive treatment. This may involve supporting the animal by providing fluid therapy, for example, and treating symptoms such as vomiting.

Some specific causes of gastroenteritis include ingestion of foreign bodies, toxins, plants, irritant drugs, intestinal parasites, viruses (e.g. parvovirus) or bacteria. In such cases, a specific diagnosis of the cause may be made after performing specific tests.

Haemorrhagic gastroenteritis is a more serious type, in which blood can be seen in the vomit and/or faeces. The cause is often unknown, but rapid supportive treatment is required.

Gastroenteritis will often come on rapidly and is characterised by a sudden onset of vomiting and/or diarrhoea. Food and bile are typically vomited; although small amount of blood may also be present. Affected pets are usually not interested in food and may feel unwell. Fever and abdominal pain are uncommon.
You should consult your vet if your dog shows signs of gastroenteritis. Advice should definitely be sought when the following symptoms are present:
check icon
persistent or intense vomiting (more than 2-3 times per day)
check icon
persistent/profuse diarrhoea
check icon
loss of appetite
check icon
depression
check icon
pink vomit or red/black stools
check icon
fever
check icon
collapse
A potentially serious complication of vomiting and diarrhoea is dehydration. This can occur quite quickly, be very dangerous to the pet’s health and, if left untreated, lead to death - especially in young animals.",ASC965
576,"A thorough history is critical to identifying an underlying cause for gastroenteritis. Questions may be related to the patient's current diet, recent change in diet, and exposure to unusual food, foreign materials, garbage, or toxins. It is also important to find out about the patient's environment, including exposure to other animals, and if other exposed animals have similar signs or a history of similar signs. Vaccination status, deworming history, and medication use are also important.

Clinical signs of gastroenteritis are often similar regardless of the underlying cause. Vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia are most common, and certain combinations of these signs may make one cause more or less likely than another. Severe inflammation or ulceration, depending on the cause, can lead to hematemesis or melena.

Physical examination is often unrewarding towards finding an underlying cause. Patients may have varying degrees of dehydration, as well as abdominal pain. In severe cases, such as those animals with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE) or parvoviral enteritis, patients may have signs of hypovolemia and shock because of the severe fluid losses and acid-base disturbances.",ASC965
577,"What Causes Gastroenteritis in Dogs? 
GI inflammation in dogs can be caused by several things including: 

Your dog ate unsafe food. This could be food that’s spoiled or harmful to dogs. 
Ingesting a foreign object. Curious canines who like to munch on more than just food (e.g., household objects or your shoes) may cause themselves harm. 
GI ulcers. You may see blood in your pet’s vomit or stool. 
Toxins. Certain foods, plants and chemicals are dangerous for dogs. 
Bacteria or viruses. Parvovirus, among other illnesses, can trigger vomiting and diarrhea. 
Parasites. Intestinal parasites such as roundworms are associated with GI upset. 
Food intolerance. Some dogs are sensitive to specific ingredients.

Dog Gastroenteritis Symptoms 
Remember, the primary signs of gastroenteritis are diarrhea and vomiting. There are, however, some other symptoms to watch for: 

Lethargy 
Stomach pain 
Lack of appetite 
Dry heaving or gagging 
Dehydration (excessive panting or dry gums)",ASC965
578,"Diagnosing Gastroenteritis in Dogs
There are a few ways you can determine if your dog has gastroenteritis.

First, note the symptoms. If they start having diarrhea and are throwing up, this may be a clear sign. Also, when examining their stool, is it healthy poop or does it look watery and loose?

A thorough inventory of diet history and environmental changes can help aid in determining the cause. 

Ultimately, your veterinarian can make a formal diagnosis. They’ll check for additional clinical signs and may conduct fecal testing, bloodwork or X-rays.

These tests can help them rule out more serious conditions such as parasites, intestinal obstructions and other diseases.

Again, if you see blood in your dog’s stool or vomit (which can resemble coffee grounds), contact your veterinarian as soon as possible.",ASC965

713,"What are Aspergillosis?
Both nasal and disseminated aspergillosis require the immediate attention of a vet. If you notice signs such as nasal discharge, nosebleeds, sneezing, or general weakness, contact a veterinarian right away.

Aspergillosis is a fungal infection caused by the Aspergillus fungus that can either affect just the nasal cavity or the entire body. Cats likely come into contact with this fungus on a regular basis, however not every cat will suffer from an infection as a result. Aspergillus exposure typically only turns into an infection if the cat already has a weakened immune system. ",ASC248
714,"Symptoms of Aspergillosis in Cats
Symptoms will vary depending on the location and extent of infection. 

Nasal aspergillosis, which is limited to the nasal cavity, is characterized by:

Excessive nasal discharge, which may have an odor
Nosebleeds
Inflamed nostrils
Sneezing
Loud breathing",ASC248

717,"Symptoms and Types
 

There are two types of Aspergillus infections. The first is the nasal form, where the infection is localized in the nasal passages and front sinuses. It is believed that this develops from direct nasal contact with the fungus. For example, if a cat is outside and around dust and grass clippings, the fungus may enter via the moist lining of the nose. The most commonly associated symptoms are nasal discharge and noisy breathing during inhaling.

 

The second type of Aspergillus infection is disseminated, meaning it is more widespread in the body, not only in the nasal area. It is not certain how this form enters the body. Disseminated aspergillosis is most commonly associated with nonspecific signs, such as lethargy, depression, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other symptoms may include protruding eyeballs.",ASC248
718,"Aspergillosis is a type of fungal infection in cats caused by the organism Aspergillus, a species of fungus. 

Two types of aspergillosis occur in cats: nasal (affects the nose) and systemic (affects internal organs)
Clinical signs depend on the type and location of the infection
Nasal aspergillosis often presents with signs of chronic nasal infection such as sneezing and nasal - discharge
Systemic aspergillosis might present with coughing, disorientation, and diarrhea depending on the organs affected
Diagnosis is challenging and often includes physical evaluation, bloodwork, and urinalysis, diagnostic imaging, and biopsies
Treatment often lasts months and involves numerous rounds of antifungal medications
Surgical removal of affected tissue might also be necessary
The prognosis of nasal aspergillosis is fair, with many cases recurring
Systemic aspergillosis has a poor prognosis due to difficulty in treatment, and many cats are euthanized",ASC248

722,"Aspergillosis is a fungal infection caused by several Aspergillus species. It is primarily a respiratory infection that may rarely spread throughout the body. Aspergillosis is found worldwide and in almost all domestic animals as well as in many wild animals; however, the susceptibility to fungal infections varies among species. Nasal cavity, sinus, and lung forms have been described in domestic cats. Cats that are already stressed by disease (such as viral infection) or immunosuppressed may be more likely to become infected. Signs are nonspecific and include inflammation of the sinuses, facial swelling, and pneumonia. The fungus can also invade the central nervous system and cause neurologic signs (such as seizures). Establishing an accurate diagnosis can be difficult and may require x-rays, computed tomography, and laboratory testing. Surgery and antifungal drugs are usually recommended to treat aspergillosis; however, the outlook depends on the overall condition of the cat and the extent of infection.",ASC248

Causes of Cryptococcosis in Cats
As the cryptococcus fungus grows in decomposing organic material, all outdoor cats are at risk of exposure. Infection is generally a sign of an underlying immune system issue. All known factors of cryptococcosis infection are listed below.

Exposure to infected soil
Exposure to fowl manure
Feline leukemia virus
Feline immunodeficiency virus
Genetic predisposition (as sometimes seen in the Siamese cat breed)",ASC955
766,"Clinical findings

Cryptococcosis is the most common of the systemic mycoses of cats. There is no gender predisposition and the age range of affected cats is broad, although young adult cats (two to three years old) appear at increased risk. It is likely that exposure and self-limiting infection occurs in the first few years of life, with disease in older cats reflecting reactivation of viable cryptococci in residual granulomatous foci. Upper respiratory tract signs are most common and include sneezing; snuffling and mucopurulent, serous or haemorrhagic, unilateral or bilateral, nasal discharge. Signs are usually chronic and in some cases, a polyp-like mass is evident in the nostril. In others, a firm to fluctuant subcutaneous swelling over the bridge of the nose is present. Cats with nasopharyngeal cryptococcosis develop stertor, inspiratory dyspnea, a tendency to open mouth breathing and sometimes secondary otitis media. Often mandibular lymphadenomegaly is evident, and ulcerated or proliferative lesions in the oral cavity are seen occasionally. Lower respiratory tract signs are rare in cats. Thoracic radiographs are usually normal, although small nodular lesions may be present. Rarely, pulmonary nodules, a mediastinal granuloma or cryptococcal pleurisy will be found.

Neurologic signs associated with cryptococcosis in cats are variable and include depression, changes in temperament, bizarre behaviour, seizures, circling, head pressing, ataxia, paresis, head tilt and other vestibular signs, anosmia and blindness. These signs may occur alone or in association with other physical findings and may result from the presence of mass-like cryptococcoma(s) or from meningoencephomyelitis. In people, cerebral cryptococcosis is often associated with increased intracranial pressure and the same is likely also in cats.

Ocular abnormalities occur in some affected cats and almost always are a marker for central nervous system (CNS) involvement. The most common sign is peripheral blindness with dilated, unresponsive pupils due to optic neuritis, exudative retinal detachment and granulomatous chorioretinitis.

Cutaneous lesions are common in cats with cryptococcosis, principally due to secondary involvement of the planum nasale. Very rarely, localized cutaneous cryptococcosis can develop following inoculation of propagules, e.g., after a cat scratch. Multifocal skin lesions are the result of haematogenous dissemination and consist of papules and nodules that are fluctuant to firm and range from 1 to 25 mm in diameter. Larger lesions tend to ulcerate, leaving a raw surface with a serous exudate. Cats with disseminated disease also may have enlargement of one or more lymph nodes, with cryptococci evident in aspirates from affected nodes. Fever is uncommon in affected cats. Cryptococcosis is typically a chronic infection, causing listlessness and weight loss due to poor appetite. Other reported signs include peripheral lymphadenomegaly (unassociated with skin lesions), bone lysis, swollen digits, chronic cough, and renal failure due to kidney involvement.",ASC955
767,"At the age of 3-months, the kitten was referred for consultation to other Veterinarians (considered day 0). The general clinical examination was normal, except for a very low body condition score (BCS=1, the cat weighted 900grams), bristling hairs and depression. Owners showed several videos of seizure episodes. Several differentials were considered, mostly related to infectious etiologies and central nervous system malformation (i.e.: hydrocephalous).",ASC955
768,"Signs may include lumpy growths over the bridge of the nose, ulcerations, sneezing sometimes with blood, blindness or other neurological signs.

This cat demonstrates numerous skin nodules filled with cryptococcus organisms.",ASC955
769,"The most common form of cryptococcal fungal infections in cats affects the nasal cavity and sinuses, with early symptoms including swelling of the nose and face. 

“Cats with this form of the infection can develop deep, non-healing ulcers of the skin and chronic nasal discharge that is clear, bloody, or full of pus; inflammation of the nasal tissues may result in sneezing or difficulty breathing as well,” Lawhon said. “Though not typically painful, C. neoformans can cause skin lesions including nodules in the skin, which are small, raised bumps.”

When cats have nasal cryptococcosis, Lawhon says they can lose weight, not only due to effects of the fungus on the body, but also because of their decreased sense of smell and interest in food.

Infections that are not promptly addressed may spread to other parts of the body, including in the lungs or central nervous system.

“Cats with disease in their central nervous system can specifically experience blindness, seizures, or changes in their behavior,” Lawhon said. “In some cases, cats will continue to develop the disease throughout the rest of the body.”",ASC955
770,"Last year, I received a phone call from a cat owner seeking a second opinion. Their four-year-old male orange tabby, Teddy, has always been a bit of a troublemaker, knocking things off counters, chasing imaginary mice and leaving no houseplant un-nibbled. Over the last few weeks, however, Teddy had been battling a stubborn upper respiratory infection (URI), and it was only getting worse, despite treatment.

I asked about his treatments, and they read me a list of about eight antibiotics that had been tried — all to no avail. “We sometimes see a little improvement, but the sneezing and nasal discharge never goes away. Now his eye has become very runny.” I asked if the cat had been tested for the feline leukemia virus, or the feline immunodeficiency virus, since both of these viruses can suppress the immune system. “He was tested twice,” replied Teddy’s owner. “Negative both times.”

I asked if the cat was ever treated with antiviral medication, instead of antibiotics. “Yes. We gave him famciclovir for two weeks.” I asked if there was any improvement. “None whatsoever,” was the owner’s response. Clearly, this was not a typical URI. I recommended that they bring Teddy in to my office so I could see him in person. We scheduled an appointment the following day.

I admit I was not prepared for the shocking site of poor Teddy’s face. Copious, thick yellow mucus was covering Teddy’s nose and pouring from his nostrils. The bridge of his nose was swollen, and the huge amount of discharge from his left eye had pasted down all the fur around his eye, sealing the lids shut. To say that this was no ordinary URI was the understatement of the year. “I don’t think this is a viral upper respiratory infection,” I told Teddy’s owners. “Instead, I suspect Teddy has a fungal disease called cryptococcosis.”",ASC955
771,"Cryptococcus infection is acquired from a contaminated environment. The main environment where the cryptococcus organism thrives is in pigeon feces. In pigeon lofts — where pigeon feces can accumulate for years and be protected from sunlight and drying — the organism can remain viable for years. The worldwide distribution of the organism is probably due to the fact that pigeons are the primary carrier. They carry the organism on their beaks, feathers and legs.

Exactly how cats become infected isn’t fully known, but inhalation of cryptococcus spores is believed to be the primary means, with the nasal cavity being the initial site of infection. Once the respiratory system is infected, the organism can spread throughout the body via the bloodstream. The most common sites that are affected by cryptococcal infection in cats are the nasal cavity, skin, lymph nodes, brain, meninges (the membranes covering the brain) and the eyes.

Skin lesions are often present in cats with cryptocccus, often consisting of solitary or multiple nodules on the bridge of the nose, which may or may not be ulcerated. Occasionally, the lungs will also be involved, reflecting the presence of cryptococcal pneumonia. Because the nasal cavity is the most common site of infection, the majority of affected cats will show signs like sneezing, noisy breathing, nasal discharge (usually thick and yellow, and occasionally bloody) and nasal deformity. Sometimes, a small polyp-like mass can be seen in one or both nostrils of affected cats.

Cryptococcus infection in the nose can spread to the back of the nasal cavity, toward the bones that separate the nasal cavity from the brain, leading to meningitis (which can manifest as behavior changes or seizures), and along the optic nerve, affecting the eyes (which can manifest as acute blindness).

I admitted Teddy to our hospital and went about gently cleaning all the discharge from his nose and face, and especially around his left eye. Fortunately, underneath all that pasted-down fur, his eye was fine. After removing the thick yellow discharge from his nose, a small pink mass was visible in his left nostril, as described above.",ASC955
