The most important risk factors for diabetes mellitus in cats are:

Obesity

Lack of physical activity

Increasing age

Gender (males are diagnosed more frequently than females)

Castration (being neutered)

Glucocorticoid (steroid) therapy

Certain medical conditions may also predispose a cat to developing diabetes.

Most Common Signs of Diabetes Mellitus in Cats 
If left untreated, diabetes mellitus can progress to a stage of the disease that is life-threatening for cats. So it’s important for you to know the symptoms of diabetes in cats, and to contact your veterinarian right away if you believe that your cat may be experiencing any of them.

Increased thirst

Increase in frequency and volume of urination

Urinating outside the litter box

Increased appetite

Weight loss (despite a hearty appetite)

Vomiting

Muscle wasting

Lethargy or weakness

Poor coat quality (oily coat, dandruff)

Plantigrade stance (less common)

In cases of uncontrolled diabetes, cats may develop damage to the nerves in their hind limbs, which causes a plantigrade stance. Instead of walking on their paws, these cats walk with a “dropped hock,” where their whole foot almost or completely touching the ground. This is a form of diabetic neuropathy.",ASC165

Excessive thirst. The dog may drink frequently and empty the water bowl more often.
Increased urination. The dog may ask to go outside frequently and may start having “accidents” in the house. Increased urination (and increased thirst) happens because the body is trying to get rid of excess sugar by sending it out through urine, along with water that bonds to the sugar.
Weight loss. The dog can lose weight despite eating normal portions. This is because the dog isn’t efficiently converting nutrients from its food.
Increased appetite. The dog can be very hungry all the time because the body’s cells aren’t getting all the glucose they need, even though the dog is eating a normal amount.",ASC165

622,"What Causes an Arrhythmia?

There are many types of heart rhythm disturbances, and just as many potential causes. While heart disease can cause an arrhythmia, an arrhythmia does not necessarily indicate that your dog has a heart condition. Other causes of heart arrhythmias include:

Hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels in the blood)
Chocolate toxicity
Imbalances in electrolytes (substances in the blood)
Drug reactions
Heartworm disease
Tumors
Trauma
What Are the Signs of an Arrhythmia?

Dogs with arrhythmias that are relatively harmless may show no outward signs. In many cases, however, an arrhythmia can lead to heart failure, changes in blood pressure, and alterations in blood flow to vital organs. Dogs with these types of arrhythmias may show signs such as:

Weakness, depression
Coughing or difficulty breathing

Symptoms:
There are three main signs of cardiac arrhythmia in dogs:

Weakness
Loss of consciousness
Long pauses between heartbeats
Types:
Heart arrhythmias in dogs fall into 5 main categories, they are:

Ventricular Arrhythmias (also known as Boxer Cardiomyopathy)
Atrial Fibrillation (Commonly seen in giant breeds such as Irish Wolfhounds and Great Danes)
Sick Sinus Syndrome (Often diagnosed in Miniature Schnauzers, West Highland White Terriers, and Cocker Spaniels)
Heart Block (A birth defect seen in Pugs, Cocker Spaniels, and Doberman Pinschers)
Myocarditis (Heart inflammation seen across all dog breeds)",ASC99
216,"Increased urination. One of the most common cat diabetes symptoms is frequent urination. If you use clumping litter, you can check out the litter box for more, or larger, clumps than usual—a possible sign of increased urination. This may be a little challenging with a multi-cat household.

Excessive thirst. A cat that urinates more often will be thirstier and spend more time at the water bowl. These first two signs of diabetes mellitus in cats, excessive urination, and abnormal thirst, are referred to clinically as polyuria and polydipsia, or PU/PD.

Increased appetite. A cat is never one to miss an opportunity for an extra treat, but diabetic cats may be more likely to beg. When a cat has diabetes, the primary energy source it gets from its food—called glucose—is not able to reach the cells. The energy-starved cells signal the brain that they are still “hungry,” which may commence the meowing for more food. This insatiable hunger, often seen in the diabetic cat, is referred to as polyphagia.

Unexpected weight loss. A cat losing weight despite increased food intake is another potential sign of pet diabetes. Because there is poor glucose uptake into the cells, the body turns to other sources of energy, burning fat and muscle, leading to weight loss.",ASC165
631,"Severe: Fainting, irregular heartbeat, open-mouth breathing, difficulty breathing.
Moderate: Murmurs, coughing, lethargy and depression, pale or bluish mucus membranes or skin, rapid breathing, vomiting.
Mild: Exercise intolerance, reduced appetite, sleeping more, unsteady gait while walking, weakness.",ASC99
621,"What Are the Signs of an Arrhythmia?

Dogs with arrhythmias that are relatively harmless may show no outward signs. In many cases, however, an arrhythmia can lead to heart failure, changes in blood pressure, and alterations in blood flow to vital organs. Dogs with these types of arrhythmias may show signs such as:

Weakness, depression
Coughing or difficulty breathing
Exercise intolerance (difficulty exercising)
Fainting episodes
Pale gums
Sudden death",ASC99
610,"Cats are very good at hiding problems. Especially because cats spend a lot of time sleeping already, a little less activity and more time spent napping might not be an obvious sign. In many cases, irregular heart rhythm can lead to changes in blood pressure and loss of blood flow to the cat's vital organs, and even heart failure. When signs do appear, they can be non-specific. It is also common for these signs to wax and wane. Common symptoms of irregular heart rhythm are: 

Heart beats too slow
Heart beats too fast
Heart gallop (during a cycle of contractions, instead of the normal 2 beats, a third sound is audible)
Heart murmur, due to turbulent blood flow within the heart
Physical weakness, due to too long of a pause in between heart beats
Depression
Fatigue
Loss of consciousness 
Difficulty breathing
Rapid breathing
Pale gums
Loss of appetite",ASC99
240,"Owners should monitor their pets for signs of diabetes, including increased thirst and/or appetite, passing more urine, and weight loss. Lethargy and weakness may become evident, and pets may be more susceptible to infections. Some pets may exhibit sunken back legs or stand on their ankles. Other symptoms include increased urination, excessive thirst, and increased hunger, leading to weight loss. Enlargement of the liver, poor coat, weakness, bladder infections, vomiting, and collapse may occur in severe cases.",ASC165

241,"Pet owners must be aware of the symptoms of diabetes in their furry companions. Look out for signs like increased thirst and/or appetite, passing more urine, and weight loss. Lethargy and weakness may develop, and pets may become more prone to infections. Some pets may display sunken back legs or stand on their ankles. Other symptoms include increased urination, excessive thirst, and increased hunger, often resulting in weight loss.

651,"Max, an 8-year-old Boxer, is struggling with cardiac arrhythmia symptoms. Despite his love for walks, he now endures frequent coughing fits, especially during physical exertion. Max's intolerance to exercise has become evident as he quickly tires out. Just last week, he collapsed unexpectedly, causing concern among his family members. During the veterinary examination, irregular heartbeats and murmurs were detected. Max appears lethargic and withdrawn, with panting and wheezing indicative of respiratory distress. His appetite has diminished, and he spends more time in slumber. Max's once steady gait has become unsteady, and sporadic retching has left him weakened.",ASC99

Signs such as increased thirst and/or appetite, passing more urine, and weight loss should not be overlooked. Lethargy and weakness may manifest, and pets may be more susceptible to infections.

Despite his fondness for walks, he now endures frequent coughing spells, particularly during physical exertion. Charlie's intolerance to exercise has become evident as he quickly tires out. Just the other day, he collapsed unexpectedly, causing concern among his family members. During the veterinary examination, irregular heartbeats and murmurs were discerned.
