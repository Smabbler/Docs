1,"What Is Cat Acne? 
If you’ve ever noticed red bumps, black dots, or dirt on your cat’s chin, your cat may struggle with cat acne, or cat chin acne.  

At its basic definition, cat chin acne is a disease in which the hair follicles—typically the ones on a cat’s chin—produce too much keratin and become plugged up. This results in red bumps, blackheads, and infected pimple-like lesions.

Cats can have a single, isolated bout of cat acne, or it may be chronic.

Chronic or severely affected cats may have so many plugged follicles that they fuse together, and form swollen, painful crusts. As the lesions get bigger, the follicles are more prone to rupture, which is a sore and often messy experience. Cat acne can also lead to chronic hair loss in the affected area.

Felines of all ages can develop acne, since it’s not believed to be related to sex hormones. Additionally, cat acne affects males and females of all breeds, as well as both and neutered and unneutered cats.

Cats that eat and/or drink out of plastic food bowls may also be at risk of cat acne, as it may stem as a form of plastic allergy.

Symptoms of Cat Acne
Symptoms of cat acne include:


	
	Redness or swelling
	
	
	Bumps and pustules
	
	
	Scabs and crusts
	
	
	Pain around the chin
	


Causes of Cat Acne
Cat acne is a poorly understood disorder that’s related to the overproduction of keratin, a key structure that makes up the outer layer of skin.

For several reasons, this excess keratin becomes trapped, causing the formation of blackheads, or comedones. When these blackheads become infected with bacteria, they form pustules that look like pimples.

Cat chin acne is believed to be associated with:


	
	Poor grooming
	
	
	Excessive sebum (oil) and keratin production
	
	
	The skin’s immune-barrier function
	


Regardless of the underlying issue, hair follicles become blocked, resulting in infection.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Cat Acne
Veterinarians diagnose cat acne based on physical exam findings, your cat’s medical history, and the elimination of other possible skin conditions.

A skin scraping and looking at a small sample of skin under the microscope may be needed to help rule out other causes, such as mange, various skin tumors, and a condition called eosinophilic granuloma complex.

Treatment of Cat Acne
Never pick at your cat’s acne. Picking will only worsen the condition and potentially cause more pain and even infection.

Cat acne treatment begins with taking any plastic food or water bowls and changing them out immediately for stainless steel. This, along with supportive care, may be all that is needed to resolve cat acne.

Treatment may also involve the use of oral or injectable antibiotics and topical shampoo or wipes.

If your cat’s skin begins to clear, the shampoos and topical treatments can gradually be stopped.

If the outbreaks of cat acne reoccur, your veterinarian will help develop an appropriate maintenance routine to keep your cat’s chin as clear as possible.

Maintenance cleansing with gentle scrubbing has been successful for many cats because it extends the amount of time between episodes and treatment.

For most patients, improved hygiene—including washing your cat’s face and wiping your cat’s chin—is core to the treatment plan for cat acne. Your vet may recommend cleaning their face with benzoyl peroxide facial wipes, but you need to get wipes specifically made for cats, as human wipes are too strong.

Clipping the nearby fur can also cut down the number of bacteria.

Recovery and Management of Cat Acne
Cat acne is typically a superficial problem and not usually one that will have serious impacts on your cat’s overall health. Most cases of cat acne are relatively harmless and respond well with improved hygiene.

Cat chin acne does become painful if it reaches the point where lesions swell and/or scab. If this occurs, more aggressive treatment is required to manage your cat’s acne.

Prevention of Cat Acne
Cat acne can often be prevented by using non-plastic food and water bowls for your feline friend. Keep their chin clean, especially if you notice any food residue or that your cat isn’t washing themselves as often.

If you see any signs of pimples or blackheads, addressing them early will make sure the condition is unlikely to progress.
Cat Acne FAQsHow long does feline acne last?Cat acne can be a one and done experience for some cats, or a long-standing and chronic problem lasting months or years for others. 
Do cats get blackheads?Cats can get blackheads on some parts of their bodies. This is true particularly for their chins, which is highly sensitive to blackheads and pimples.

What Is High Blood Pressure in Dogs?
Blood pressure is the pressure or amount of force exerted by the blood against the arterial vessel walls, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). It is measured by two numbers:


	
	Systolic: the pressure measured during heart contraction
	
	
	Diastolic: the pressure measured when the heart relaxes
	


With every beat of the heart, oxygen-rich blood and nutrients are pumped throughout the body and delivered to the tissues. Higher blood pressure, also called systemic hypertension, means a higher workload, or strain, for the heart and vessels, which will cause damage to the vessels themselves as well as damage to other organs such as the eyes, kidneys, and brain.

What Is a Normal Blood Pressure in Dogs?

It is difficult to measure diastolic blood pressure in dogs—so, systolic blood pressure is often used as a sole criterion for diagnosing high blood pressure. In dogs, a blood pressure less than 150mmHg is considered normal, but a blood pressure of 160mmHg should be investigated as pre-hypertension. Hypertension is diagnosed when the blood pressure is measured consistently above 180mmHg.

Symptoms of High Blood Pressure in Dogs
In most dogs with high blood pressure, there won’t be noticeable or overt symptoms. However, damage is often caused to the internal organs, causing or worsening kidney disease, and affecting the heart or brain.

Heart murmurs and clot formation may develop, and blindness can occur suddenly with lesions seen in the retina. There may be blood in the eye, in the urine, or out of the nose (epistaxis). Behavioral changes and weakness, as well as seizures, coma, and death can occur.

Causes of High Blood Pressure in Dogs
High blood pressure has three different causes:


	
	Primary, or idiopathic: means the cause is unknown (this cause typically is uncommon in dogs)
	
	
	Secondary: often attributed to an underlying disease such as:

	
		
		Cushing’s, kidney disease
		
		
		Diabetes
		
		
		Pheochromocytoma (adrenal tumor)
		
		
		Diet
		
		
		Polycythemia (increase in red blood cells)
		
		
		Side effects of certain medications (phenylpropanolamine and steroids)
		
	
	


Dogs with any of the above conditions should have their blood pressure measured in part to treat the condition itself.


	“White coat effect”: Similar to what has been described in humans, this is a short increase in blood pressure often occurring due to fear or anxiety. For example, when your pet is taken to the vet and is clearly nervous or stressed, this will trigger a higher blood pressure than normal during this event. This condition doesn’t require treatment and normalizes when the cause is removed.


How Veterinarians Diagnose High Blood Pressure in Dogs
There are some methods to measure a dog’s blood pressure in the hospital, and each has its own limitations and accuracy:


	
	Direct via arterial measurement: Although the most accurate, this method is also the most invasive (and risky), as it requires puncturing an artery. (This method is typically reserved for dogs in critical condition.)
	
	
	Indirect oscillometer: Readily available and easy to use, this method is less accurate than direct measurement.
	
	
	Indirect via Doppler: More accurate than the oscillometric method and easy to use, using a Doppler will enable the vet to obtain only a systolic blood pressure reading.
	


Prior to diagnosing high blood pressure, multiple readings over the course of a few visits or occurrences should be done, to ensure the accuracy and decrease the “white coat effect.” Measuring trends and allowing the dog to acclimate to the machine and testing can be helpful in decreasing stress-related elevations.

Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Dogs
In most cases, even when the underlying disease is managed, dogs with high blood pressure will require lifelong medication for treatment. The goals of treatment are to prevent organ damage and symptoms. Usually, a single medication is prescribed, but multiple drugs may be required if the response to a single medication is minimal. Drugs such as enalapril (an ACE-I) or amlodipine (calcium channel blocker) are most common; others like phenoxybenzamine or atenolol (alpha and beta blockers), or even hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide (diuretics) can be used. In emergency settings, drugs like hydralazine and nitroprusside are routinely prescribed. 
 

Recovery and Management of High Blood Pressure in Dogs
The good news is that, for some dogs, high blood pressure can be resolved once the underlying disease process is either treated or managed effectively. However, most dogs will require lifelong medication to manage high blood pressure.

Additionally, dogs should be re-examined and their blood pressure measured within a few weeks of starting medication, as the goal of therapy is to obtain a normal blood pressure (<150mmHg). It should be measured again every couple of months thereafter. Follow your veterinarian’s recommended recheck guidelines going forward.

Additional tests such as bloodwork and urine testing may also be recommended at these appointments, which are important to determine any damage to other organs from the disease or side effects of the medication. Your dog probably already has follow-up appointments to manage his other underlying disease.
High Blood Pressure in Dogs FAQsHow can pet parents help their dog with high blood pressure?Desensitizing your dog to having his blood pressure taken can be done at home with practice and patience. Ask your veterinarian to borrow a cuff or purchase one yourself—anything to make the process of reading his blood pressure easier and less stressful will be helpful toward managing his condition.

Decreasing stressful events (for example, exposure to thunderstorms, fireworks, and strangers) can be immensely helpful in maintaining a more stable blood pressure. Salt restriction is often not necessary, but a high salt intake should be avoided. Talk to your veterinarian about possible dietary recommendations.
How long can dogs live with hypertension?The timeframe is variable, but with proper care, follow-up, and monitoring, a better prognosis can be afforded when your dog’s blood pressure is adequately controlled. The risks of developing more serious complications are also decreased.

Cat asthma is a recurring respiratory (breathing) condition that is characterized by inflammation (swelling) in the lungs and narrowing of the airways. Asthma is caused by contact with an allergen such as dust or pollen your cat inhaled while breathing. Asthma can be made worse by stress. Cats affected by asthma may show signs of coughing, difficulty breathing, and wheezing.  

Although these symptoms may come and go, depending on your cat’s contact their allergens, asthma will not clear up without long-term treatment.

Symptoms of Cat Asthma

The most common signs include:  

Coughing, which can look like gagging or vomiting  

Difficulty breathing  

Breathing that looks like it is coming from the belly instead of the chest  

Noisy “wheezy” breathing 

Causes of Cat Asthma

Feline asthma is caused by an allergic reaction triggered when the cat inhales a allergen such as dust, cigarette smoke, pollens, dust mites, mildew, cat litter, and household chemicals. Even being exposed to candles, hair spray, and room fresheners can trigger a flare-up in sensitive cats.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Asthma in Cats

If you notice signs of asthma in your cat like difficulty breathing, you should visit the emergency vet. If your cat is coughing but still breathing normally, you can book a regular appointment. Once at the vet, cats with signs of asthma will usually require a basic blood panel, a heartworm profile, and chest radiographs.  

Some cats may also need more testing, which may include fecal tests for lung parasites as well as airway washes to look for the cause of the lung inflammation. In some cases, the diagnosis is very easy and straightforward, but other cats will require more extensive testing. Unfortunately, vets often are unable to figure out what started the process in the first place. 

Treatment for Asthma in Cats

Because the primary problem involved in asthma is the underlying inflammation, treatment is aimed at reducing this inflammation. It is generally not possible to eliminate the allergens your cat is inhaling. Even if your cat is not showing symptoms, they will need to continue the anti-inflammatory medication.  

Long term, the safest way to give this medication is using an inhaler, much as would be done for humans with asthma. Some cats are treated with oral or injectable anti-inflammatories instead of inhaled medication. The risks of side effects are higher with the oral treatments, however, so inhalers are generally preferred. 

Recovery and Management of Asthma in Cats

With proper care, the vast majority of cats with asthma will respond to treatment and experience only occasional flare-ups of symptoms. However, even if your cat’s symptoms seem to disappear, it is very important to continue with treatment because the underlying inflammation is still simmering and can cause long-term disease. When asthmatic cats are treated, they are likely to do very well.

Asthma in Cats FAQs
How can I treat my cat’s asthma at home?

After diagnosis, asthma is usually treated at home using inhaled anti-inflammatory medications daily, with a rescue inhaler to use if there’s a significant flare-up. Some cats will be treated (at least short-term) with oral medications in addition to, or instead of, the inhalers.

Can asthma kill a cat?

Yes. Just as untreated asthma in humans can be fatal, the same is true in cats.

What does a cat with asthma sound like?

Some cats with asthma will cough and look like they are trying to bring up a hairball. Other cats will have an audible wheeze when breathing.

How much does it cost to treat a cat with asthma?

The cost to treat a cat with asthma depends on which medication your vet prescribes, where you choose to have that prescription filled, and the severity of the asthma. In all cases, however, proper treatment will likely be much less expensive than a single visit to an emergency facility for a cat that is struggling to breathe.

Does my cat have asthma or a hairball?

Asthma is a disease of the lungs, while hairballs come from the stomach. When cats with hairballs vomit their back is arched, and they vomit up fluid and hair, often while walking backward.  

When cats with asthma cough: their neck and back are straight and parallel to the floor, and they don’t usually move backward while coughing. If you are not sure which symptom your cat has, it is best to video the event to show your veterinarian what is happening. 

What triggers asthma in cats?

Asthma in cats is triggered when a cat inhales an allergen that causes an allergic reaction. Allergens include dust, cigarette smoke, pollens, dust mites, mildew, cat litter, and household chemicals.

This is an airway disease that can cause coughing and respiratory distress.  Feline bronchitis describes a group of common inflammatory airway diseases of cats that include feline asthma.

The inflammation of the bronchi causes the walls of the airways to become thickened and swollen, along with excessive mucus production, with secretions gathering in the airways. It’s a useful comparison to think about how nasal secretions gather when you have a cold, and you can remove these by blowing your nose.

When similar secretions gather in the airways, deep inside the lungs, it’s difficult to clear these away, and that’s why the signs of bronchitis are seen. Constriction (narrowing) of the airways can also happen due to an allergic reaction, and this aggravates the signs of bronchial disease.",ASC104

215,"Diabetes mellitus (commonly referred to as diabetes) is a disease of the endocrine system that results from an insulin deficiency. Either the body doesn’t produce enough insulin, or it can’t use the insulin that’s produced.

You may be surprised to find out that cats can have diabetes, too. Here’s a complete guide to diabetes in cats, from symptoms and causes to treatment and life expectancy.

Why Is Insulin So Important?

Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, a small but vital organ located next to the upper segment of the small intestine.

Insulin is necessary for regulating the level of glucose (sugar) in the bloodstream and controlling the delivery of glucose to tissues in a cat’s body. When insulin is present and functioning normally, glucose is transported from the blood into the tissues and converted by the cells into energy.

In cats with diabetes mellitus, the transport of glucose from the blood to the tissues is disrupted, resulting in hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose) and a state of relative starvation.

Types of Diabetes in Cats

Similar to people, several classifications of diabetes mellitus exist in veterinary medicine.

Type I Diabetes Mellitus

Type I diabetes mellitus is also called insulin-deficient diabetes. This type of diabetes, where the pancreas is unable to produce the level of insulin that the body needs, is rarely seen in cats.

Type II Diabetes Mellitus

Type II diabetes mellitus is also called insulin-resistant or non-insulin-dependent diabetes. This is the most common form of diabetes mellitus in cats.

Type II diabetes is characterized by a relative insulin deficiency. This means that even though the cat’s pancreas may produce adequate levels of insulin, the tissues are unable to use it for glucose metabolism.

Which Cats Are at Risk for Diabetes?

It is estimated that between 0.5-1% of the general feline population suffers from diabetes, but an increasing number of cats are being diagnosed each year.

Any cat has the potential to develop diabetes throughout their lifetime, but certain breeds, such as the Burmese, have been reported to carry a higher lifetime risk.

Most commonly, diabetes is seen in middle-aged, male indoor cats that are obese.

The most important risk factors for diabetes mellitus in cats are:


	
	Obesity
	
	
	Lack of physical activity
	
	
	Increasing age
	
	
	Gender (males are diagnosed more frequently than females)
	
	
	Castration (being neutered)
	
	
	Glucocorticoid (steroid) therapy
	


Certain medical conditions may also predispose a cat to developing diabetes.

Most Common Signs of Diabetes Mellitus in Cats 

If left untreated, diabetes mellitus can progress to a stage of the disease that is life-threatening for cats. So it’s important for you to know the symptoms of diabetes in cats, and to contact your veterinarian right away if you believe that your cat may be experiencing any of them.


	
	Increased thirst
	
	
	Increase in frequency and volume of urination
	
	
	Urinating outside the litter box
	
	
	Increased appetite
	
	
	Weight loss (despite a hearty appetite)
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Muscle wasting
	
	
	Lethargy or weakness
	
	
	Poor coat quality (oily coat, dandruff)
	
	
	Plantigrade stance (less common)
	


In cases of uncontrolled diabetes, cats may develop damage to the nerves in their hind limbs, which causes a plantigrade stance. Instead of walking on their paws, these cats walk with a “dropped hock,” where their whole foot almost or completely touching the ground. This is a form of diabetic neuropathy.

Unfortunately, many of the symptoms of diabetes in cats are not specific to diabetes alone. So take your cat to your veterinarian to rule out other diseases (such as kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, or pancreatitis).

How Blood Glucose Relates to the Symptoms You See

In all cases of diabetes mellitus (regardless of type), there is an excessive level of glucose in the blood (hyperglycemia).

When the blood glucose reaches a certain threshold, it begins to overflow into the urine (glucosuria) and draws large volumes of water out with it. This results in excessive urination (polyuria) and dehydration.

In an effort to combat dehydration, cats often also begin drinking excessive amounts of water (polydipsia). 

Despite the elevated level of glucose in the blood, not enough glucose is transported to the cells, so they become starved for energy.

In response to perceived starvation, a cat’s body begins to break down fat and protein stores for energy, which results in weight loss and cachexia (muscle wasting) in cats. This weight loss often occurs despite the cat having an increased appetite (polyphagia).

How Do Vets Diagnose Feline Diabetes?

Diabetes is diagnosed by the presence of the typical clinical signs in the face of persistent fasting hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose), and glucosuria (glucose in the urine).

This can be diagnosed by performing full bloodwork and a urinalysis. Your veterinarian may also use the blood sample to perform a serum fructosamine, which allows them to prove that the blood glucose has been elevated over time, and not just at the time it was measured in the hospital.

Diabetic Ketoacidosis

Through additional testing, your veterinarian might also find:


	
	Elevated liver enzymes
	
	
	Elevated kidney values
	
	
	The presence of ketones in the blood or urine
	
	
	Electrolyte imbalances
	
	
	Other metabolic disturbances
	


These symptoms may be caused by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

DKA is a form of diabetes in which the cells (which cannot access glucose) use free fatty acids as an energy source. These free fatty acids are broken down into molecules called ketoacids.

As ketoacids and glucose accumulate in the blood, it can become life-threatening for your cat.

Cats that have progressed to a state of DKA have more severe clinical signs, which may include:


	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Anorexia (not eating)
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Progressive weakness or lethargy
	
	
	Depression
	
	
	Coma
	


In these cases, your cat needs a full workup, including x-rays and an ultrasound, which will help identify other diseases and diabetic complications.

Treatment of Feline Diabetes

Managing feline diabetes is a lifelong commitment that requires vigilance and good communication between you and your veterinarian.

At the time of diagnosis, your cat may need to be hospitalized for several days until their glucose level is controlled and they are feeling well. If your cat is in a state of diabetic ketoacidosis at the time of diagnosis, they will likely require extended hospital stays and intensive care.

The primary goals of treatment of feline diabetes are centered on:


	
	Restoring normal blood-glucose levels
	
	
	Reducing or eliminating the clinical signs of excess thirst and urination
	
	
	Normalizing weight and appetite
	
	
	Avoiding inducing inappropriately low glucose levels
	


Your veterinarian will develop a plan that is tailored to your cat’s specific needs. If your cat has concurrent diseases, your veterinarian will recommend treatment for those as well.

At-Home Insulin Therapy

The vast majority of cats diagnosed with diabetes mellitus require daily injectable insulin therapy.

Oral diabetic drugs, such as those used in human patients, are typically less effective and prescribed much less frequently for cats.

Blood-Glucose Curve

There are a variety of different insulin preparations available for cats, and each cat responds to insulin therapy differently (some are more sensitive than others).

As such, performing a blood-glucose curve at the time of diagnosis is very important. This is a series of timed blood-glucose measurements taken over the course of a day, most often in the hospital.

A blood-glucose curve will identify the insulin type and dosing frequency that works best to control your cat’s glucose levels, while avoiding periods of inappropriately low glucose (hypoglycemia).

Once an effective treatment plan has been identified, your veterinarian will show you the proper way to administer insulin injections at home. Follow your veterinarian’s instructions closely.

Adjusting Your Cat’s Insulin Dose

Unfortunately, regulating feline diabetes can be complicated, and it’s normal for the vet to make frequent changes to your cat’s treatment plan, especially at the time of diagnosis.

After your cat has been receiving insulin at home for a week or so, they will need to return to the veterinarian to have a glucose curve performed.

Based on your cat’s symptoms and the test results, the insulin dose is adjusted, and the glucose curve is repeated. This cycle continues until your cat has fewer or lessened symptoms and their blood-glucose levels are controlled within an acceptable range.

It may take up to several months to find the right insulin dose to regulate your cat’s diabetes.

Caring for a Diabetic Cat

You will need to do a few tasks consistently to help manage your cat’s diabetes.

Monitoring Your Cat’s Glucose Levels

At-home monitoring of your cat’s blood-glucose levels is important for monitoring your cat’s glycemic control long-term. This typically involves pricking the inside of your cat’s ear and using a glucometer (alpha-trak).

Glucose levels can also be monitored in a less invasive manner, by measuring glucose levels in the urine, although this method is not as accurate as blood measurements.

Not all cats are amenable to blood-glucose monitoring at home. Your veterinarian will work with you to determine the method of monitoring that works best for you and your cat.

Monitoring Your Cat’s Insulin Response

One of the most serious risks and potential complication of managing a diabetic cat at home is the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).

This can happen to any pet being managed for diabetes at home, even if you give them the appropriate dose (or less than the appropriate dose) prescribed by the veterinarian.

For this reason, it’s important that you strictly follow your veterinarian’s instructions and schedule for feeding and giving insulin, and that you never administer a full dose of insulin to your pet if they are not eating.

Signs of Hypoglycemia in Cats

Hypoglycemia is a serious and potentially life-threatening state that should be treated as an emergency.

Signs of hypoglycemia in cats might include:


	
	Dull mentation or disorientation
	
	
	Profound weakness or lethargy
	
	
	Gastrointestinal signs (vomiting, diarrhea, not eating)
	
	
	Trembling
	
	
	Seizures
	
	
	Coma
	


If you see any of these signs, give your cat a sugary product (corn syrup, maple syrup, honey) and immediately go to an emergency pet hospital.

If your pet is having seizures, try rubbing syrup on their gums, but be cautious of your cat biting you.

Managing Your Cat’s Diet and Weight

Nutrition is a very important part of managing diabetes in cats.

Your veterinarian may recommend a diet change to help regulate your cat’s glucose levels and promote weight loss, as obesity complicates diabetes management.

This often involves switching your cat to a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet. There are several diabetic prescription diets on the market for cats, and your veterinarian will work with you to identify a diet plan that is appropriate for your cat.

Once you have identified a nutritional plan that works for your cat, it’s critical that you maintain a strict feeding schedule.

Do NOT change your cat’s diet suddenly without consulting your veterinarian.

Providing Appropriate Exercise

Keeping your cat physically active is another important component of helping your cat achieve a healthy weight. Ask your veterinarian for tips on how you can encourage your cat to be more active.

If taken seriously, and appropriate weight loss is achieved, diabetic cats may even enter diabetic remission, a point where at-home insulin injections are no longer necessary.

Keeping a Daily Log of Your Cat’s Health

You need to keep a daily log of your cat's diet, glucose test results, daily insulin dose, and weekly body weight so you can see trends and recognize when your cat deviates from their regular pattern. Any change in patterns should be brought to your vet’s attention.  

Life Expectancy for Diabetic Cats

Treatment of feline diabetes is a major, life-long commitment requiring significant dedication from all family members. It also requires consistent, open communication with your cat’s veterinarian.

With appropriate veterinary care and at-home management, cats diagnosed with diabetes mellitus can go on to live a healthy and happy life without having their diabetes shorten their life expectancy considerably. In some cases, diabetic cats may even go into remission.

If your cat was diagnosed with other illnesses, this might complicate the regulation of your cat’s diabetes and/or affect your cat’s long-term prognosis.

216,"Increased urination. One of the most common cat diabetes symptoms is frequent urination. If you use clumping litter, you can check out the litter box for more, or larger, clumps than usual—a possible sign of increased urination. This may be a little challenging with a multi-cat household.

Excessive thirst. A cat that urinates more often will be thirstier and spend more time at the water bowl. These first two signs of diabetes mellitus in cats, excessive urination, and abnormal thirst, are referred to clinically as polyuria and polydipsia, or PU/PD.

Increased appetite. A cat is never one to miss an opportunity for an extra treat, but diabetic cats may be more likely to beg. When a cat has diabetes, the primary energy source it gets from its food—called glucose—is not able to reach the cells. The energy-starved cells signal the brain that they are still “hungry,” which may commence the meowing for more food. This insatiable hunger, often seen in the diabetic cat, is referred to as polyphagia.

Unexpected weight loss. A cat losing weight despite increased food intake is another potential sign of pet diabetes. Because there is poor glucose uptake into the cells, the body turns to other sources of energy, burning fat and muscle, leading to weight loss.",ASC165
217,"Early signs. The owner will sometimes notice certain symptoms that can be early signs of diabetes:

Excessive thirst. The dog may drink frequently and empty the water bowl more often.
Increased urination. The dog may ask to go outside frequently and may start having “accidents” in the house. Increased urination (and increased thirst) happens because the body is trying to get rid of excess sugar by sending it out through urine, along with water that bonds to the sugar.
Weight loss. The dog can lose weight despite eating normal portions. This is because the dog isn’t efficiently converting nutrients from its food.
Increased appetite. The dog can be very hungry all the time because the body’s cells aren’t getting all the glucose they need, even though the dog is eating a normal amount.",ASC165

256,"There are three phases of infection with FIV - the acute phase, the asymptomatic (or latent) phase, and the progressive phase. 

The acute phase of infection generally occurs 1-3 months after infection. At this time, the virus is carried to lymph nodes, where it reproduces in white blood cells known as T-lymphocytes. The virus then spreads to other lymph nodes throughout the body, resulting in temporary lymph node enlargement that is often accompanied by fever, depression, and lack of appetite. This phase of infection may be very mild and is often missed by owners or attributed to other causes of fever.

Following the acute phase, cats will enter an asymptomatic phase, which may last for months to multiple years. During this time, the virus replicates very slowly within the cells of the immune system, and cats will not show any outward signs of illness. Infected cats may exhibit blood work abnormalities, such as low white blood cell levels or increased blood proteins. Some cats will remain in this stage and never progress to more severe disease.

As the virus continues to spread through the immune system, cats will enter a progressive immunocompromised state during which secondary infections may occur. Most illness related to FIV is not from the virus itself, but from these secondary infections or problems with the immune system. Cats may develop chronic or recurrent infections of the skin, eyes, urinary tract, or upper respiratory tract. Inflammation of the gums and severe dental disease, known as gingivostomatitis, is common in cats infected with FIV, and they are significantly more likely to develop cancer and immune-mediated blood disorders than healthy cats. Weight loss, seizures, behavioral changes and neurological disorders are all possible. The severity of these illnesses can vary greatly, but once cats become ill with multiple critical infections or cancers, survival time is usually no more than a few months. ",ASC231

What Is FIV in Cats (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus)?

Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a virus that’s found in domestic cats that attacks the immune system. FIV leads to increased susceptibility to infections and other disease.

Is Feline AIDS the Same as FIV in Cats?

FIV is the virus that causes and can eventually progress to feline acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), usually years after initial infection.

How Do Cats Get FIV?

The most common way that FIV spreads among cats is through biting.

The saliva of an FIV-positive cat contains the virus, so it can spread to another cat through a bite wound.

The most frequently infected cats are typically aggressive male cats that are allowed to freely roam.

Another way that FIV can spread is from a mother cat to her kittens, although it is very rare. This can happen either during pregnancy, birth, or nursing.

Is FIV Contagious to Other Cats?

The risk of transmission between friendly household cats that stay indoors is low.

But it can be spread through biting, so FIV-positive cats should be kept indoors where they cannot infect others. Cats that don’t have FIV can stay protected if you keep them inside as well.

Although the risk of transmission through social/friendly contact is low, it is not impossible. Ideally, infected cats should be kept separate from uninfected cats to eliminate the risk of transmission.

If this is not possible, remember that transmission is less likely between cats in a stable household (the cats do not fight, there’s no introduction of a new cat, etc.).

What Are the Symptoms of FIV in Cats?

Since FIV affects a cat’s immune system, symptoms will only appear once the cat has contracted a secondary infection.

Here are a few signs that FIV might be an underlying issue:


	Fever
	Lethargy
	Lymph node enlargement
	Salivation
	Weight loss
	Abscesses
	Decrease in appetite
	Diarrhea
	Abortions or stillbirths
	Chronic or recurrent infections (respiratory, skin, bladder, eye)
	Conjunctivitis and uveitis
	Weakness
	Seizures
	Behavior changes
	Lymphoma or leukemia


What Are the Stages of FIV in Cats?

There are a few different stages of FIV in cats. Here’s what to expect in each stage.

Acute Phase

The acute phase occurs after initial infection. Some cats will experience lethargy, fever, or lymph node enlargement. This stage lasts one to three months.

Latent Infection

The latent infection period has no symptoms and can last months to years. Many cats will not progress beyond this stage.

Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (Feline AIDS)

If a cat reaches this phase of infection, they become immunocompromised and are susceptible to secondary disease. This usually occurs years after initial infection. Feline AIDS symptoms are those that are related to secondary infections.

Terminal Phase

Once a cat reaches the terminal phase, the prognosis is approximately two to three months. During this time, it’s common to see severe infections, cancer, neurologic disease, immune-mediated disease, etc.

Can FIV in Cats be Cured?

Unfortunately, there is no cure for FIV in cats, but there are treatment options that can help your FIV-positive cat live a healthy life.

How Do You Treat FIV in Cats?

The mainstay of FIV treatment in cats includes treating and preventing secondary infections or disease.

Immunosuppressive drugs and steroids should be avoided.

Some antiviral medications have been shown to help FIV-positive cats with seizures or stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth), but they have not been shown to prolong a cat’s life span or reduce the infection rate or severity.

You can help keep your FIV-positive cat healthy by:


	
	Using routine parasite control
	
	
	Feeding a complete and balanced diet
	
	
	Visiting the veterinarian every six months for routine exams and bloodwork
	


Please avoid raw diets, as they can cause illness in immunocompromised animals.

Do Cats Die From FIV?

While FIV itself does not typically result in death itself, it does cause increased susceptibility to diseases that can sometimes be fatal, especially in cases where the virus has progressed to feline AIDS.

FIV-positive cats that become clinical for the disease usually succumb to secondary infection, cancer, or immune-mediated disease.

What's the Life Expectancy for Cats With FIV?

Cats with FIV can have a normal lifespan with excellent quality of life; however, because they are more susceptible to disease, severe illness can lead to a worse prognosis.

Is There an FIV Vaccine for Cats?

There is a vaccine that can help provide protection against FIV; however, it is not always completely effective. Vaccination will also lead to false positive results, so it is important to know a cat’s vaccine history prior to testing for FIV antibodies.

How Do You Prevent FIV in Cats?

The best way to prevent FIV in cats is to prevent exposure by:


	
	Keeping your cat indoors
	
	
	Spaying or neutering your cat
	
	
	Keeping your cat separated from FIV-positive cats

260,"Feline AIDS is a viral infection, commonly known as FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus), and is spread by cats fighting. Just like human HIV (AIDS), cats infected with FIV can develop a reduced ability to fight off infections as the disease progressively disables the immune system.

What are the signs of Feline AIDS? Once infected, cats may seem healthy and signs may not develop for up to 10 years. Eventually cats with AIDS will show a range of vague non-specific symptoms as the virus interfers with normal immune function.

 Anorexia (loss of appetite)
 Weight loss
 Depression
 Dermatitis
 Mouth and gum disease
 Persistent diarrhoea, vomiting and anaemia
 Respiratory, urinary and skin infections
 Nervous system problems",ASC231
261,"Clinical Signs
There are three phases of infection with FIV - the acute phase, the asymptomatic (or latent) phase, and the progressive phase. 

The acute phase of infection generally occurs 1-3 months after infection. At this time, the virus is carried to lymph nodes, where it reproduces in white blood cells known as T-lymphocytes. The virus then spreads to other lymph nodes throughout the body, resulting in temporary lymph node enlargement that is often accompanied by fever, depression, and lack of appetite. This phase of infection may be very mild and is often missed by owners or attributed to other causes of fever.

Following the acute phase, cats will enter an asymptomatic phase, which may last for months to multiple years. During this time, the virus replicates very slowly within the cells of the immune system, and cats will not show any outward signs of illness. Infected cats may exhibit blood work abnormalities, such as low white blood cell levels or increased blood proteins. Some cats will remain in this stage and never progress to more severe disease.

As the virus continues to spread through the immune system, cats will enter a progressive immunocompromised state during which secondary infections may occur. Most illness related to FIV is not from the virus itself, but from these secondary infections or problems with the immune system. Cats may develop chronic or recurrent infections of the skin, eyes, urinary tract, or upper respiratory tract. Inflammation of the gums and severe dental disease, known as gingivostomatitis, is common in cats infected with FIV, and they are significantly more likely to develop cancer and immune-mediated blood disorders than healthy cats. Weight loss, seizures, behavioral changes and neurological disorders are all possible. The severity of these illnesses can vary greatly, but once cats become ill with multiple critical infections or cancers, survival time is usually no more than a few months. ",ASC231

What Is Anemia in Cats?
Anemia in cats is the deficiency of red blood cells and hemoglobin (or both) in a cat’s blood.

Red blood cells (RBCs), which are made by the bone marrow, are the main way oxygen is carried to the body’s tissues and organs. Specifically, an iron-containing protein in RBCs called hemoglobin carries the oxygen.

When a cat is anemic, the decrease in RBCs and/or hemoglobin leads to decreased oxygen flow to the body’s organs. This decrease in oxygen may result in damage to organs like the heart, lungs, and kidneys, potentially causing failure.

Anemia in cats is often a medical emergency and can become life-threatening. If you are noticing that your cat has pale gums, is lethargic, is collapsing, and/or has other signs of anemia, seek emergency veterinary attention.

Some causes of anemia, though emergent, may be treatable and have a good prognosis. Other cases, such as cats who are anemic with chronic kidney disease, may have a shortened life expectancy.

Types of Anemia in Cats

Anemia in cats is broadly categorized as either regenerative or non-regenerative.


	
	Regenerative anemias—When the bone marrow produces enough RBCs to correct the anemia. The cat will have a low red blood cell count, but there will be immature RBCs in circulation, indicating the body is trying to replace what it has lost.
	
	
	Non-regenerative anemias—When the bone marrow is not able to correct for the deficiency of RBCs, either because it’s not functioning properly or because the body’s resources have been exhausted. An anemia can also be non-regenerative if it’s caught too early before the body has had a chance to respond to the loss of RBCs.
	


There are many potential causes of anemia, and some causes can co-exist at the same time.

Symptoms of Anemia in Cats
Symptoms of anemia include some—or all the following:


	
	Lethargy 
	
	
	Pale gums (sometimes the gums are yellow, indicating jaundice)
	
	
	Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing
	
	
	Increased heart rate
	
	
	Weakness or collapse
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	


Causes of Anemia in Cats
Anemia isn’t a disease itself but rather secondary to diseases or conditions in the body that cause anemia. The causes of anemia can be broken down into three broad categories. This includes blood loss, destruction of RBCs, and a failure to produce new RBCs.  

Blood loss can be internal (inside the body), external (outside the body), or both. Some common causes of blood loss in cats include:


	
	Trauma, such as being hit by car
	
	
	Fleas/ticks that suck blood from the body—this can be significant in newborn kittens
	
	
	Hookworm infestations that feed on the blood in the intestines
	
	
	Bleeding tumors 
	
	
	Severe stomach ulcers 
	
	
	Diseases that prevent proper blood clotting such as hemophilia
	
	
	Anticoagulant rodenticide toxicity (when a cat ingests rat poison that prevents blood clotting, leading to bleeding)
	
	
	Post-surgical complications, such as a suture on a blood vessel coming undone or breaking
	


Destruction of RBCs (also called hemolysis) can occur due to the following:


	
	Immune mediated hemolytic anemia (where the cat’s immune system attacks and destroys its RBCs) 
	
	
	Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection or feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) 
	
	
	Certain blood parasites such as Mycoplasma haemofilis (formerly known as Haemobartonella felis), Cytauxzoon felis, and Babesia felis which are spread to cats through tick bites 
	
	
	Toxins and chemicals from onions, zinc, copper, or acetaminophen (Tylenol)
	
	
	Drugs, including reactions to antibiotics and antiparasitic agents
	
	
	Genetic diseases such as pyruvate kinase deficiency in Abyssinian and Somali cats
	
	
	Neonatal isoerythrolysis, a condition in newborn kittens when the blood type of the kitten and the mother cat are not compatible 
	
	
	Low phosphate, seen in refeeding syndrome, which occurs in cats who have been starved and then suddenly start eating a lot again, causing electrolyte abnormalities
	
	
	Cancer 
	


Failure to produce new RBCs means the bone marrow that produces RBCs is unable to keep up with the demand for new ones. When a cat is anemic, the bone marrow should be able to produce more RBCs to compensate.

Reasons for failure to produce new RBCs include:


	
	Anemia of chronic disease—Any chronic disease or illness can lead to anemia due to long-term inflammation that decreases RBC production. Chronic conditions include chronic infection, tumors, and disorders of the hormone system (such as hypothyroidism). This is the most common type of anemia in animals.
	
	
	Chronic kidney disease—The kidneys produce a hormone called erythropoietin, which stimulates the development of RBCs by the bone marrow. With significant kidney disease, the kidneys do not produce enough erythropoietin, decreasing RBC production (which leads to anemia). 
	
	
	Severe nutritional deficiencies or imbalances
	
	
	Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)
	
	
	Autoimmune disease or inflammation affecting the bone marrow
	
	
	Chemicals or toxins affecting the bone marrow
	
	
	Cancer affecting the bone marrow or RBC directly
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Anemia in Cats
Your vet will perform a physical exam on your cat, followed by blood work. The blood work will show that your cat has a low red blood cell count or a low hematocrit (percentage of blood that is made of RBCs). The blood work may show other changes, such as a low platelet count or high white blood cell counts, which your veterinarian may use to help determine what type of anemia your cat has.

After a pet is diagnosed with anemia, your veterinarian will recommend additional tests to determine the underlying cause of the anemia.

If there are no signs of external blood loss (bleeding from wound, nose, etc.), internal bleeding will be ruled out. This is done using diagnostic imaging such as X-rays and/or ultrasound.

If no signs of bleeding are noted, your veterinarian will perform additional blood tests. They may also recommend testing for diseases spread by tick bites, or other specialized tests. 

A urinalysis should be performed to check your cat’s organ function and assess other causes of anemia. Your vet may also take a fecal sample from your cat. This is to rule out parasites.

A FeLV/FIV snap test is another important test to help your vet determine the cause of your cat’s anemia.

If there is concern the cat’s bone marrow is not responding properly, your veterinarian may recommend a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy to collect a sample of bone marrow for analysis. For this procedure, your cat is usually under anesthesia. A needle is inserted into the bone to collect a sample of the marrow. The sample is then sent to a specialty lab that can examine the bone marrow under a microscope.

Often, severely anemic cats will be sent to a local veterinary emergency hospital for hospitalization, 24-hour care, blood transfusions, advanced diagnostics, and consultation with specialists.  

Treatment of Anemia in Cats
In cases of severe anemia, a blood transfusion will likely be needed.

Once the cat is stabilized, attention will be directed at identifying and treating the underlying cause of the anemia. Treatment will vary based on the underlying cause of the anemia but may include:


	
	Steroids (prednisolone) and other immunosuppressive medications like cyclosporine or chlorambucil
	
	
	Antibiotics
	
	
	Gastroprotectant medications, which are medications that coat any ulcers and prevent worsening of vomiting if present
	
	
	Deworming medication
	
	
	Surgery in the case of a bleeding tumor or a complication from a previous surgery
	
	
	Darbepoeitin, a medication given to cats with chronic kidney disease to replace erythropoietin
	
	
	Iron supplementation
	


If your cat has gone through trauma, surgery may be needed to stop the bleeding and address the anemia. If the anemia is severe or persistent, additional transfusions, oxygen therapy, and other supportive care may be needed.  

Recovery and Management of Anemia in Cats
Severely anemic cats will likely need to be hospitalized for two to seven days while they receive treatment. Severely anemic cats or those with autoimmune conditions or cancer can have poor or uncertain prognosis. These cats may need long-term treatment.

Many cats with mild anemia—when treated early, and in overall good health—will typically make a full recovery and have no long-term effects. However, some cats with mild anemias, such as those with chronic kidney disease, may get progressively worse, even with treatment.

The prognosis for cats with blood loss, secondary to trauma, will vary depending on the extent of the trauma and how quickly they receive treatment.

Prevention of Anemia in Cats
Not all causes of anemia in cats are preventable, but there are steps you can take to decrease your cat’s overall risk. These include:


	
	Keep your cat indoors to reduce the risk of trauma and transmission of diseases like FeLV or FIV.
	
	
	Vaccinate your cat against FeLV.
	
	
	Keep your cat on parasite prevention that includes intestinal worms, fleas, and ticks.
	
	
	Follow your veterinarian’s recommendations for how often your cat needs wellness exams and blood work. This will help you catch conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, early. Earlier intervention can slow progression.
	
	
	Feed your cat a regular, healthy diet.
	
	
	Keep toxic substances, such as onions or acetaminophen, out of reach of your cat.
	
	
	After surgical procedures, follow your veterinarian’s recommendations regarding activity restriction.
	

Anemia in Cats FAQsHow do I get an anemic cat to eat?Anemic cats may benefit from appetite stimulants like maropitant citrate (Cerenia®). You can also try feeding something extra special like warm canned food. Follow your veterinarian’s recommendations for managing the underlying cause of anemia.
What causes low blood count in cats?A low blood count can be caused by blood loss, the destruction of red blood cells, or a failure of the body to make enough red blood cells.

307,"Anemia in cats may come about in three ways: by blood loss, by a problem with RBC production, or by conditions in which RBCs are destroyed. Sometimes, more than one of these factors is involved.

Common causes of anemia in cats include:

Blood loss due to internal or external bleeding.
Auto-immune conditions where the immune system destroys its own RBCs.
Severe flea infestations.
Toxin ingestion. Examples include rat poison, zinc, lead, acetaminophen (Tylenol), and onions.
Certain infections, such as feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).
Blood parasites (many of which are carried by fleas or ticks).
Stomach ulcers or bleeding in the intestines caused by intestinal parasites, certain medications, or inflammatory bowel disease.
Chronic kidney disease.
Other chronic diseases.
Blood clotting disorders.
Certain cancers, especially lymphoma and leukemia.
Anemia may affect any cat, although specific underlying causes are more common depending on a cat’s age or lifestyle. For example, fleas and other parasites are most likely to cause anemia in kittens. And anemia of chronic disease (where the body doesn’t produce enough RBCs anymore) is more likely in older cats.

Also, going outdoors puts cats at an increased risk of anemia due to trauma/injuries, parasites, and infections.",ASC26
308,"If the anemia is mild, a cat might not show any obvious symptoms—especially if the anemia is chronic and their body has had a chance to adjust and cope. Or they may show some of the milder symptoms listed below.

With moderate anemia, symptoms are often “non-specific,” meaning they could be due to a number of different diseases and don’t specifically point to anemia. Common symptoms include:

Lethargy
Exercise intolerance or lack of interest in play
Decreased appetite
Personality changes, such as hiding more often
Pale gums
Increased heart rate or breathing rate
Blood in the urine or stool
As anemia progresses and becomes severe, a cat might show these symptoms:

Weakness or severe lethargy.
Very pale or white gums.
Jaundice (yellow tint to the gums, skin, and whites of the eyes). Usually, this is only seen with sudden rupture (hemolysis) of large numbers of RBCs.
Collapse.
Trouble breathing.
Open-mouth breathing.
Death.
Additionally, a cat may experience symptoms related to the underlying disease that caused anemia. Common examples include vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, increased urination, and drinking, or a fever.",ASC26
309,"Because anemia starves the body of oxygen (the body’s fuel), the first sign is often lethargy. An anemic cat may have little energy to play or may sleep more than usual. The cat’s gums may appear almost white or even yellow (a condition called jaundice) due to red blood cell destruction. In extreme cases, the cat may have trouble breathing, and respiratory and heart rates can increase as the body tries to compensate for the lowered oxygen delivery by the red blood cells.

Depending on the cause of anemia, fever and loss of appetite may occur due to an infection or inflammatory response. Black stools can be seen if blood loss occurs in the stomach or intestinal tract, and discolored urine can be a sign of red blood cell destruction. The signs of anemia can be very vague, however, and if a cat has been anemic for a long time, their body has likely had time to compensate and the cat may show no signs at home.",ASC26

What Is Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar) in Cats?
Blood sugar, or glucose, is the main source of energy for both the body and the brain. Low levels of blood glucose, called hypoglycemia, will deprive the body and brain of energy, resulting in unconsciousness. If left untreated, it can lead to death. The opposite condition, high blood glucose levels, is often a sign of diabetes mellitus.

Hypoglycemia is the most common side effect of insulin administration for the treatment of diabetes. The effects of insulin are long-lasting (working for hours), so complications from an overdose will worsen with time, and a pet can progress from stable to critical condition very quickly. As noted, if left untreated, hypoglycemia can be fatal to your cat.

Symptoms of Hypoglycemia in Cats

	
	Weakness
	
	
	Lethargy/depression
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Blindness
	
	
	Lack of coordination/stumbling
	
	
	Anxiety
	
	
	Seizures
	
	
	Coma
	
	
	Death
	


Causes of Hypoglycemia in Cats
Cats under treatment for diabetes are at a higher risk for developing hypoglycemia. Mistakes that can be made when administering insulin include:


	
	Giving too much insulin
	
	
	Using a mismatched needle and syringe
	
	
	Missing or delaying meals
	
	
	Change in the diet or amount fed
	
	
	Change in time of insulin administration
	


Other causes of hypoglycemia in cats that are unrelated to the administration of insulin for diabetic patients include:


	
	Infection or illness
	
	
	Decreased appetite or vomiting
	
	
	Change in the body’s need for insulin
	
	
	Concurrent hormonal disease
	
	
	Interaction of insulin with other medications
	
	
	Increase in activity
	
	
	Heatstroke
	
	
	Liver disease
	
	
	Kidney disease
	
	
	Remission of diabetes
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Hypoglycemia in Cats
Hypoglycemia can be easily diagnosed in the hospital. A blood glucose level check will reveal a lower-than-normal blood glucose level. In combination with your cat’s history and clinical signs at the hospital, a diagnosis can be made for hypoglycemia.

To determine the underlying cause of the hypoglycemia, a thorough history and review of the insulin administration is required. If inappropriate administration does not appear to be the cause of the hypoglycemia, the following tests may be performed:


	
	Blood Chemistry Profile: to assess the health and function of the liver, kidneys, and pancreas
	
	
	Complete Blood Count: to identify abnormal red and white blood cell counts and patterns, which could identify an underlying disease such as anemia, dehydration, or infection
	
	
	Urinalysis: to evaluate kidney function and check for a urinary tract infection
	
	
	Cortisol Test: to reveal abnormalities in the body’s stress hormone, which could affect its ability to metabolize insulin
	
	
	Thyroid Test: to evaluate the amount of thyroid hormone
	
	
	Imaging: X-rays and ultrasounds are used to check for tumors, abscesses, infection in the abdomen, liver shunts, and liver abnormalities
	


Treatment of Hypoglycemia in Cats
Initially, treatment is aimed at raising low blood glucose levels. Depending on the severity of the blood glucose level and the clinical signs at the time of the diagnosis, treatment can vary to include:


	
	Oral Options at Home: If you notice any symptoms of hypoglycemia (as listed above), take your cat to the hospital immediately. For transport to the hospital, pet parents can apply Karo® corn syrup or honey to the gums only. (Do not force anything to be swallowed or into the mouth.) When you arrive at the hospital, be sure to inform the staff of any home treatments you started.
	


It is important to note that hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia can produce similar signs in cats (stupor, depression, lethargy), so without confirmation of low blood glucose levels, or a known insulin overdose, do not apply more Karo syrup or honey to the gums in diabetic patients.


	
	Oral Options at the Hospital: Similar to options at home, a source of glucose is applied to the gums. In the hospital, cats are monitored for changes in their clinical signs and improving blood glucose levels. If levels are very low or cats are not responding to the gum application, an intravenous administration is typically started.
	
	
	Intravenous (IV): The application of glucose to the gums is not as effective as intravenous dextrose. A continuous-rate infusion is beneficial for cats that do not respond to an initial IV dextrose injection.
	
	
	Supportive Care: In severe cases of hypoglycemia, appropriate nutrition and warming are needed. Seizures are treated with anticonvulsant medication.
	


Once the patient is stable, further investigation of the cause of the hypoglycemia can be performed.

Recovery and Management of Hypoglycemia in Cats
The clinical signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia should improve within minutes of treatment. In cases of a large insulin overdose, however, repeated treatments are needed over time to counteract the long-lasting action of insulin. In those cases, cats may be kept in the hospital for a continuous infusion of dextrose.

Pet parents of a cat with diabetes should always have a source of glucose and a blood glucose monitor readily available to treat confirmed hypoglycemia following an insulin overdose. After an administration of glucose alleviates the obvious signs of hypoglycemia and a cat can eat on their own, small amounts of food should be offered every 1-2 hours until the effects of the insulin overdose have been counteracted.

Ways to decrease hypoglycemia from an insulin overdose include:


	
	Maintain strict feeding times (same times each day)
	
	
	Administer insulin near the time of eating
	
	
	Avoid changes in the diet/food (including treats)
	
	
	Schedule routine bloodwork monitoring as suggested
	
	
	Provide a consistent level of exercise and play each day

What Is Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar) in Cats?
Blood sugar, or glucose, is the main source of energy for both the body and the brain. Low levels of blood glucose, called hypoglycemia, will deprive the body and brain of energy, resulting in unconsciousness. If left untreated, it can lead to death. The opposite condition, high blood glucose levels, is often a sign of diabetes mellitus.

Hypoglycemia is the most common side effect of insulin administration for the treatment of diabetes. The effects of insulin are long-lasting (working for hours), so complications from an overdose will worsen with time, and a pet can progress from stable to critical condition very quickly. As noted, if left untreated, hypoglycemia can be fatal to your cat.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Hypoglycemia in Cats
Hypoglycemia can be easily diagnosed in the hospital. A blood glucose level check will reveal a lower-than-normal blood glucose level. In combination with your cat’s history and clinical signs at the hospital, a diagnosis can be made for hypoglycemia.

To determine the underlying cause of the hypoglycemia, a thorough history and review of the insulin administration is required. If inappropriate administration does not appear to be the cause of the hypoglycemia, the following tests may be performed:

362,"The two most common signs of diabetes noticed by owners at home are weight loss despite a good appetite and increased thirst and urination. 

Weight loss may be noticed at home or during a routine examination with the veterinarian. In both Type I and Type II diabetes, the cells in the body are unable to absorb glucose from the blood and become starved of energy. To get the energy it needs, the body turns to other sources, breaking down fats and proteins to feed glucose-starved cells. This breakdown results in weight loss, despite an increased appetite.

Excessive thirst and urination can also signal diabetes in a cat. High levels of sugar in the blood can overwhelm the ability of the kidney to filter glucose, allowing sugar to “spill out” of the blood and into the urine. This high urine glucose concentration can actually pull excessive amounts of water into the urine, resulting in increased urine volume, increased urinary water loss, a propensity for dehydration, and a compensatory increase in thirst.

In rare cases of uncontrolled diabetes, cats may experience damage to the nerves in the hind limbs, resulting in a “plantigrade” stance of the hind limbs (walking or standing with their hocks on or close to the ground). This is not painful, and will often resolve with treatment.",ASC332

Every cat is different, but if your cat’s blood sugar starts to drop, you may notice they start to develop one or more of the symptoms below: 

1. Changes to eating habits
Watch out for any signs your cat is eating more, or less, than usual. Hypoglycaemia can create food cravings in some cats, while others may eat far less if they’re feeling weak or dizzy.

2. Weakness and lethargy
Low blood sugar means there’s less fuel available to help power your cat’s muscles. This can sometimes lead to weakness, lethargy and a general reluctance to move.

3. Bumbling behaviour
Hypoglycaemia can cause blurred vision, disorientation and confusion. These issues can impact your cat’s ability to carry out normal tasks like using their cat flap or jumping onto furniture.

4. Jerking or twitching
If left untreated, a hypoglycaemic episode can lead to trembling, collapse or even seizures. These often occur just before a cat loses consciousness, a situation that should be treated as an emergency.",ASC332

What is Arthritis in Cats?
Arthritis (also called degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis) is a chronic, painful, progressive condition involving the joints of cats. As in people, this is commonly associated with aging, and likely impacts between 70% and 90% of cats over 12 years old.

Arthritis usually takes years to develop, with many changes occurring in the joints. The cartilage that normally lines and cushions the joint breaks down, allowing bones to rub together abnormally. Nearby bone may splinter and form sharp, bony projections into the joint. These leads to swelling, inflammation, and pain in the joints.

Most affected joints include the spine, hip, knees, and elbows—although any joint can develop arthritis. It is a progressive disease, meaning it continues to worsen over time. Because these joint changes cause pain, cats can show decreased mobility and lameness when they have arthritis.

While there is no breed or sex predilection for arthritis in cats, it is typically viewed as an aging disease.

Symptoms of Arthritis in Cats
Some cats with arthritis may not show any obvious signs—they can be very good at hiding their pain! Some obvious signs of arthritis include limping, swollen joints, and muscle wasting.

However, cats may display arthritis differently, and make it difficult for owners to recognize. Some cats may become hesitant to jump or play like when they were younger. They may have decreased energy or agility falling when they attempt to jump up or down on surfaces.

It may be difficult for them to move their body without pain to groom, so cats may be more unkempt. Some pet parents note changes in posture, such as not sleeping or sitting normally. If arthritis causes pain when they use the litter box, they may associate the litter box as the cause of the pain and start eliminating outside it. It is important to note that these changes do not occur overnight and usually happen gradually.

Causes of Arthritis in Cats
Arthritis can occur without known reasons, although genetics may play a role. This type is most associated with aging. Arthritis can also occur after an injury to the joint. These injuries can be minor in nature, and could be caused by:


	
	Ligament injury (such as ACL tear)
	
	
	Immune-mediated diseases, such as immune-mediated non-erosive polyarthritis
	
	
	Tick-borne diseases, like Lyme disease
	
	
	Direct trauma (such as a car accidents or a fall)
	
	
	Infection
	
	
	Congenital defect
	


Arthritis progresses due to the nature of the joint itself. After an injury, the cartilage releases enzymes within the joint that cause further breakdown of the cartilage and collagen, resulting in more inflammation.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Arthritis in Cats
Veterinarians may suspect arthritis in cats based on their physical exam, but it requires further testing for a definitive diagnosis. However, some cats are stoic and asymptomatic. These cats are most often diagnosed with arthritis incidentally—after feeling abnormalities on an exam or during an X-ray.

During a physical exam, veterinarians may find the following in a cat with arthritis:


	
	Lameness
	
	
	Changes in gait, posture, or sitting position
	
	
	Difficulties sitting or getting up
	
	
	Swollen or thickened joints
	
	
	Crepitus, or clicks in joints when moving
	
	
	Pain on palpation of joints
	
	
	Decreased range of motion of joints
	


While a veterinarian may strongly suspect arthritis, they need further diagnostics to confirm. X-rays are the standard diagnostic test to easily view bones and joints for changes. X-ray abnormalities include:


	
	Joint distention
	
	
	Bony outgrowths
	
	
	Soft-tissue thickening
	
	
	Narrowed joint spaces
	
	
	Calcified free-floating bony lesions (called joint mice)
	


Veterinarians may suggest a trial of pain medications to determine the degree of pain.

Treatment of Arthritis in Cats
Arthritis is extremely common with our feline companions, but there are many options to help them feel better and remain active. With appropriate management, we can slow the progression and allow them to lead very full lives. A multi-modal approach typically works best — multiple therapies used together for a better outcome.

Obesity is one of the most concerning factors for arthritis. Overweight cats put more strain on their joints. Lowering the weight of a heavy cat with arthritis is the first step to take in easing the strain on their joints. Weight reduction diets can be started. Talk to your veterinarian to discuss the right food and caloric intake for your pet.

Other treatment options include medicines, supplements, therapies, and surgery. Here is an overview of treatment possibilities for arthritic cats:

Pain Medications:


	
	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (like meloxicam and Onsior) are great at relieving pain and inflammation. However, they can have a significant strain on internal organ function and can have restrictions on the length of treatment.
	
	
	Gabapentin is used for many purposes, and its pain-reliving properties make it a good option for painful, arthritic cats.
	
	
	Opioids can be used, but they require additional precautions and may cause sedation.
	
	
	Polysulfated glycosaminoglycan (Adequan): This is an injectable prescription medication that supports joint health by stopping destructive enzymes within the joint. This medication is not labeled for use in cats, so talk to your veterinarian about using it off-label.
	
	
	Amantadine may also provide pain relief in some cats.
	
	
	Frunevetmab (Solensia) is a newer drug using monoclonal antibodies developed specifically for cats with arthritis. There are few studies in cats, but may be a beneficial drug for this treatment.

	Omega-3 fatty acids may decrease the inflammation in joints.
	
	
	In recent years, CBD (cannabidiol, an active ingredient in cannabis) has received attention for its pain-relief qualities. However, there is limited data in pets to know the effectiveness of CBD and similar products. In addition, legal issues surrounding CBD make it difficult to acquire, prescribe, and obtain quality and safe products. Talk to your veterinarian about all pain management options before starting treatments.

	Laser therapy (also known as a cold laser) can dramatically decrease inflammation and pain. Laser treatment typically starts with multiple treatments within a week and then tapers to the lowest effective dose.
	
	
	Acupuncture may help in some cases, although not all cats are agreeable to the process.
	
	
	Stem cell therapy has shown promising work in dogs, horses, and humans, but requires more research in cats.
	
	
	Warm/cold compresses for temporary pain relief, increasing blood flow and decreasing inflammation.
	
	
	Physical therapy can help with weight loss and joint mobility.
	
	
	Surgery is not always the first step, but it may ease the pain from some forms of arthritis. It is important to note that most surgeries involving joints will not guarantee that arthritis will not return over time, but such a procedure may allow a better quality of life. Surgical options include joint fusions, joint replacement, and amputation.
	


Recovery and Management of Arthritis in Cats
Arthritis is not reversible, so cats will never fully recover. But treatments can slow its progression and lead to an increased quality of life. Many cats with arthritis show few clinical signs, so diligent monitoring is essential.

Unless a previous disease or trauma occurred, most cats with arthritis are over age 10 when diagnosed—although arthritis may have started years earlier. New studies show around 60% of cats 6 years old have signs of arthritis.

As your cat ages, you may notice decreased ability to jump, play, and groom. They may start using the bathroom outside the litter box due to pain. Without treatment, arthritis can progress to debilitating and painful diseases. Talk to your veterinarian about the appropriate steps to treat your cat with arthritis.

Prevention of Arthritis in Cats

Because obesity is linked to arthritis, it is best to keep your cat lean. If your cat is already overweight, institute a weight loss program, following your veterinarian’s advice. Ask about arthritis in cats and start using cartilage protectant medications and supplements early. By doing so, you protect the cartilage that is there before it is too late.
Arthritis in Cats Condition FAQsWhat are the signs of arthritis in a cat? Many cats show few or no signs of arthritis. You may notice decreased grooming, decreased mobility, and lameness.
What age does arthritis start in cats? Most cats are diagnosed over 10 years of age, but arthritis likely starts much sooner than that.
How can I help my elderly cat with arthritis? Talk to your veterinarian to determine your cat’s appropriate weight and what you can do to slow arthritis’ progression.

While pneumonia refers to an inflammation of the cat's lungs, bacterial pneumonia refers specifically to an inflammation of the lungs in response to a disease-causing bacteria. This inflammation is characterized by an accumulation of cells and fluid in the lungs, airways, and alveoli (the portion of the airways in which oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged).



Prognosis for bacterial pneumonia is generally good if properly treated. However, there are two secondary effects (hypoxemia and sepsis) that may result from bacterial pneumonia, and which are associated with increased fatalities. Hypoxemia refers to severely low levels of oxygen in the blood, while sepsis refers to the presence of pus-forming bacteria and their poisons in the cat's blood stream.



Bacterial pneumonia may occur in both dogs and cats, although this condition is more common in dogs. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.



Symptoms and Types



Symptoms of bacterial pneumonia include cough, fever, difficulty breathing, lack of appetite and consequent weight loss, sluggishness, nasal discharge, dehydration, and rapid breathing. Intolerance to exercise due to breathing difficulties may also be apparent. Listening to the lungs with a stethoscope may reveal abnormal breathing sounds, a diagnostic process known as auscultation. Symptoms may include short rough snapping sounds known as crackles and whistling sounds known as wheezes.



Causes



Causes of bacterial infection in a cat's lungs may vary -- no single bacterium is responsible for this condition. In cats, the bacterial organisms Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella, and Moraxella are most frequently reported in cases of bacterial pneumonia. Although, cats seem less likely to contract bacterial pneumonia than dogs.



Some risk factors that may increase the risk of bacterial pneumonia include a pre-existing viral infection, difficulty swallowing, metabolic disorders, and regurgitation.



Diagnosis



Bacterial pneumonia is just one cause of pulmonary dysfunction. Additional causes may include aspiration pneumonia, in which the lungs become inflamed due to inhalation of material, such as a foreign body, or vomit. The symptoms of bacterial and aspiration pneumonia may be similar, and diagnosis must properly determine between them in cases of pulmonary dysfunction.



If bacterial pneumonia is suspected, there are a number of diagnostic procedures that may be done on the cat. A tracheal wash may be performed to gather material (fluids and cells) lining the trachea for analysis. Because the bacteria cannot always be seen via microscope, any specimens taken should be cultured for further examination. Other tests may include visual imaging, specifically X-rays of the cat's chest and lungs. Blood analysis, and urine analysis tests will also be conducted.







Treatment



Medication is necessary in cases of bacterial pneumonia; the proper antimicrobial can be selected based on results of bacterial cultures taken from a tracheal wash, for example. Additional treatment depends on the severity of signs. If multiple symptoms occur, such as anorexia, high fever, and weight loss, your cat will be actively treated in a hospital to start.



If respiratory distress is apparent, oxygen therapy may be necessary. To avoid dehydration, the veterinarian may recommend administering electrolytes by intravenous (IV) fluid therapy.



Restrict your cat's activities throughout treatment, except as part of physiotherapy, or to help improve clearing of the lungs and airways. Along with rest, be attentive to your cat's needs, and prevent it from lying in one position for long periods of time.



Living and Management



After initial treatment, your cat should be fed a diet high in protein and energy density. Your veterinarian will monitor your cat's progress with blood tests, and if needed, x-rays of the chest and lung cavity. Any prescribed antimicrobial medications should be administered regularly, as prescribed by your veterinarian.



Prevention



One way in which bacterial pneumonia can be prevented is by ensuring that your cat receives its regular vaccinations.

462,"A hallmark sign of pneumonia is a deep, soft cough that may not be productive, meaning your pet may or may not cough up mucus. The lung sounds of pets with pneumonia may sound loud and harsh or may be soft, as air is not circulating through areas of lung tissue affected by pneumonia.",ASC505
463,"Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs and airways that causes breathing difficulties and deficiency of oxygen in the blood. There are many possible causes. The most common cause of pneumonia is a viral infection of the lower respiratory tract. Canine distemper virus, adenovirus types 1 and 2, canine influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus cause damage to the airways and make the animal susceptible to the development of pneumonia.

Parasitic invasion of the bronchi can also result in pneumonia. Tuberculous pneumonia, although uncommon, is sometimes seen in dogs. Fungal pneumonia (see below) is also seen in dogs. Injury to the mucous membranes of the bronchial tubes and inhalation of irritants may cause pneumonia directly, as well as making the animal susceptible to bacterial infection. Aspiration pneumonia (see below) may result from persistent vomiting, abnormal movement of the esophagus, or improperly administered medications (for example, oil or barium) or food (forced feeding).

Signs of pneumonia include lethargy, loss of appetite, and a deep cough. Labored breathing, “blowing” of the lips, and bluish mucous membranes may be evident, especially after exercise. Body temperature is moderately increased. Complications such as pleurisy (inflammation of the lining around the lungs) or infection by additional organisms may occur.

Diagnosis usually involves a combination of history, physical examination (including listening to the lungs with a stethoscope), and appropriate tests. Your veterinarian may be able to hear wheezing sounds within the lungs. In the later stages of pneumonia, the increased lung density caused by inflammation can be seen on x-rays. Analysis of fluid used to “wash” the airways is valuable for the diagnosis of bacterial infections. Bacterial culture and drug sensitivity testing help the veterinarian to determine the best course of antibiotic treatment, if needed. A viral infection generally results in an increased body temperature.

Animals with pneumonia benefit from a warm, dry environment. If the mucous membranes are very bluish (indicating poor oxygen in the blood), the veterinarian may administer oxygen. Antibiotics are usually given, although the treatment may be modified based on the results of laboratory cultures, so that the drugs given best match the type of infection found. Additional treatments, such as bronchodilators and nebulization (""breathing treatments""), may be necessary. The dog may need to be reexamined frequently, including periodic chest x‑rays, to watch for improvement or recurrence, to follow an underlying disease (if one is present), or to detect any possible complications.",ASC505

It might surprise you to discover that they can. Learn to recognize the signs of pneumonia in dogs, so you can give your pet a speedy and effective recovery.
What Are Dog Pneumonia Symptoms?
The most obvious indicator of dog pneumonia is a deep cough. This sort of cough is often what you might describe as wet-sounding. Other signs of pneumonia in dogs include:

Rapid breathing
Labored breathing or wheezing
Fever
Runny nose
Decreased appetite
Lethargy
Lowered tolerance for exercise
Blue gums (if the situation is severe)
To diagnose pneumonia, your vet will look at your dog’s symptoms and medical history to uncover risk factors. They’ll also give your dog a thorough physical examination. This could include taking your dog’s temperature and listening to your dog’s chest with a stethoscope to listen for crackling, popping, or other abnormal sounds in the lungs.",ASC505
465,"What is Dog Pneumonia?
Pneumonia is irritation and inflammation within the lungs that results in the buildup of fluid within the air sacs. This compromises the normal exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide within the lungs, resulting in difficult breathing. Pneumonia can be caused by various reasons, including:

Bacteria
Viruses
Fungal organisms
Parasites
Immune-mediated
Inhalation of stomach contents, food, chemicals, fluids, foreign materials
Inhalation of chemicals, smoke
Pneumonia ranges from mild symptoms that affect small parts of the lungs to complete respiratory distress and an inability to breathe normally. Many cases of pneumonia require veterinary intervention immediately and should be treated as an emergency.

Affected dogs tend to be nervous at night, may be reluctant to go into dark rooms, or may bump into things when the light is dim. Pet owners with dogs that are developing PRA often observe that their pet's eyes have become very reflective when light shines on them, and that the pupils are more dilated than normal. Both eyes are affected.
In some cases, the pet owner may not notice anything abnormal when their dog is at home but may gradually notice that their pet is clumsier when in unfamiliar surroundings. For dogs with the inherited form, the initial sign may only be a loss of day vision or could be complete blindness.",ASC516
511,"Although PRA can lead to total blindness, the vision loss it causes is gradual. Therefore, in the beginning, PRA might be virtually undetectable by a dog’s owner. Dr. Klein advises what to watch out for. “Since PRA is not a painful condition, many owners may not notice early onset. At some point, most owners notice hesitancy when their dogs move or walk in dark areas or different surroundings. Some dogs may become more anxious in dark or shaded areas.”

In addition to night blindness and anxiety, you might see that your dog’s pupils are more dilated than usual. You might also notice that when light shines on your dog’s eyes, they reflect the light more strongly than they used to. If you see any of these symptoms, take your dog to the vet for a thorough examination.",ASC516

What Is Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats?
Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is a genetic disorder of the retina that can, over time, lead to blindness in both eyes.

Considered rare in cats, PRA affects the retina which converts light to electrical and chemical signals. These signals are transmitted through the optical nerve to the brain to form pictures. The retina is composed of specialized photoreceptor cells called rods and cones. Rods function better in dim lighting and help detect motion and shapes, while cones work better in bright light and have a greater sensitivity to detect colors.

Types of PRA in Cats

Progressive Retinal Atrophy is a general term for several inherited disorders affecting the retina. However, the disorders can be grouped into two main types. The types differ in when PRA develops and whether the inherited gene is recessive (requiring a recessive gene from each parent) or dominant (only one gene is required).


	Photoreceptor degeneration. Photoreceptor cells gradually deteriorate, with symptoms developing around three to five years of age. This type is recessively inherited and plays a role in rod development.
	Photoreceptor dysplasia. This form is only seen in Abyssinian cats, occurring when photoreceptor cells do not develop properly early in a kitten’s life. Symptoms develop early, with blindness within a few months of birth. This type has a dominant mode of inheritance.


Symptoms of Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats
Most cats will begin to experience night blindness initially, because the condition affects the rod photoreceptor cells first. Vision loss will gradually worsen over the months and years. PRA affects both eyes.
Other symptoms you may notice include:


	Disorientation and bumping into objects
	Difficulty finding food and water bowls, or toys
	Reluctance to go up or down stairs, or enter a dark room
	Reclusive at night
	Dilated pupils
	Sluggish pupillary light reflexes, as well as diminished or loss of other eye-related reflexes
	Greater reflectiveness (sheen) of the eye
	Cataracts, which often manifest as white-opaque crystalline deposits in the eyes, occur usually as a secondary complication


Causes of Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats
PRA is an inherited condition, meaning one or both parents have a gene that causes the condition. Abyssinians are the breed most often associated with PRA. Other breeds predisposed to PRA include:


	
	Persian
	
	
	Siamese
	
	
	Somali
	
	
	Ocicat
	
	
	Oriental shorthair
	
	
	Bengal
	
	
	Cornish Rex
	


Males and females are equally affected, and because this condition is inherited, it is most noticeable in kittens and younger cats. 

How Veterinarians Diagnose Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats
Your veterinarian may initially suspect PRA during a routine eye exam, especially in kittens because there are notable changes in the appearance of the retina. Diminished or absent eye reflexes may be noted as well, but they may not always show up in the earlier stages of the disease, and a referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist may be necessary. 

The ophthalmologist often will evaluate the eye with specialized lenses and may recommend a more advanced procedure called electroretinography (ERG), in which electrical signals are measured against the retina and recorded. This test can determine if the retina is functioning properly. 

Other tests such as blood work, urine testing, blood pressure analysis, testing for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and taurine blood levels may be recommended. The results from these tests not only provide a baseline but can also help exclude other conditions that also cause blindness. 

Additionally, there are genetic/DNA tests available which can identify carrier animals so breeders can make well-informed ethical breeding decisions. Affected cats should not be bred. 

Treatment of Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats
Although no effective treatment or cure exists, it does not cause pain. No medications or supportive care, other than some environmental modifications, are required and it does not require future follow-up visits. 

Over time, your cat will become blind, and if you notice your pet bumping into objects or seems to be disoriented, reach out to your veterinarian for advice on how to manage this new development.

Recovery and Management of Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats
Most cats adapt well to this condition because the loss of vision is progressive, and cats have time to adapt and learn to rely on their other senses. The key to managing this condition is ensuring a safe home environment:


	
	Minimize relocating furniture
	
	
	Block off access to the stairs, pools, etc.
	
	
	Keep the floor free from clutter
	
	
	Keep your cat indoors
	
	
	Apply padding to sharp edges and corners
	


Be sure to get your cat’s attention prior to approaching or petting her to prevent startling her.  Voice commands can be useful when navigating around the home. 

Proper diet is important, as well as including the amino acid taurine in their diet. This ingredient can be helpful in preventing retinal disease. Most commercially prepared diets have enough taurine already included. Be sure to look for diets that are AAFCO approved or ask your veterinarian for recommendations. 
Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats FAQsHow common is PRA in cats?Thankfully, PRA is an uncommon condition in cats, but purebreds are at a higher risk especially Abyssinians. Responsible breeding can play a role in reducing this disease in the cat population.
What causes PRA in cats?PRA is an inherited condition. The defect is attributed to either the CRX or CEP290 genes, which play a role in proper retina function, as the retina of the eye converts light into electrical impulses which further creates vision. 
Can PRA be cured in cats?Unfortunately, there is neither a treatment nor cure for this condition, but it does not cause the cat pain. Cats can adapt to their blindness and can continue to have a good quality of life.

What Is Gastroenteritis in Dogs?
Gastroenteritis in dogs is defined as an inflammation of a dog’s stomach (gastro-) and small intestine (-enteritis). In simple terms, gastroenteritis is an upset stomach. Pet parents might use the term “dog stomach bug” to describe this kind of illness, but the possible causes go beyond a viral infection.

If your dog has bloody diarrhea or vomit, go to the emergency vet immediately, as these are signs of acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS).

Acute Hemorrhagic Diarrhea Syndrome (AHDS) / Hemorrhagic Gastroenteritis (HGE)

Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome, also known as hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE), is a specific and critical form of enteritis. It is a medical emergency and one of the most serious causes of diarrhea in dogs.

AHDS can be fatal—your dog can become septic (caused by a dangerous infection in the bloodstream), lose too much protein, or experience complications.

Dogs affected with this disease have been shown to have inflammation of only the intestines, not the stomach. If you suspect your dog has AHDS, take them to the vet immediately.

Symptoms of Gastroenteritis in Dogs 
Take your dog to the emergency vet if you see the signs of AHDS:


	
	Sudden onset of bloody diarrhea with no known cause, such as a change in diet
	
	
	Vomiting, with or without blood
	
	
	Lethargy  (moving slowly, sluggish)
	


Call your vet if your dog is showing any signs of gastroenteritis:


	
	Sudden vomiting
	
	
	Sudden diarrhea
	
	
	Lethargy
	


Dogs suffering from gastroenteritis exhibit a sudden onset of vomiting and/or diarrhea and may lose a large volume of body fluids and electrolytes. This can cause dehydration. Monitor your dog’s hydration and activity level.

If your dog is dehydrated and/or lethargic, go to the emergency vet. This indicates a more serious situation that needs immediate treatment.

You can check for dehydration by gently lifting the skin on the back of your dog’s neck. If it stays raised and doesn’t go back to place quickly, your dog is probably dehydrated.

Another tip to test your dog for dehydration: press on your dog’s gums, which should turn from white back to pink within 2 seconds. If the pink takes any longer to come back, your dog is probably dehydrated.

Other signs of dehydration include:


	
	Panting
	
	
	Dry nose and eyes
	
	
	Dry, pasty gums and thick saliva
	
	
	Loss of appetite
	
	
	Loss of skin elasticity (when you pull your dog’s skin and it is slow to snap back)
	


Causes of Gastroenteritis and AHDS in Dogs
Gastroenteritis in dogs can be caused by many underlying issues. Your vet can run diagnostic tests to help you figure out why your dog is sick. Some possible causes include:


	
	Dietary indiscretion (meaning your dog ate something they shouldn’t, such as fatty food, food that’s gone bad, or inedible objects)
	
	
	Gastric ulcers
	
	
	Toxins
	
	
	Cancer
	
	
	Kidney failure
	
	
	Liver failure
	
	
	Bacterial infection, such as clostridium, campylobacter, salmonella, or E. coli
	
	
	Viral infection, such as parvovirus, coronavirus, or distemper
	
	
	Parasites
	
	
	Food allergies
	


The exact cause of AHDS remains unknown. Some vets theorize that the condition begins with a bacterial infection in the intestine caused by Clostridium perfringens type A.

This infection creates dangerous toxins that erode the protective lining of the intestine, allowing fluids and blood to leak out.

How Vets Diagnose Gastroenteritis in Dogs 
This diagnosis is made when a dog has a sudden case of vomiting or diarrhea, has been sluggish and lethargic, and hasn’t had an appetite. Describing your dog’s symptoms can help your veterinarian make the diagnosis. Your vet will also check your dog for dehydration and signs of abdominal pain.

To rule out other possible causes of vomiting and diarrhea, such as parvovirus, parasites, a gastrointestinal obstruction, cancer, kidney disease, and other more serious conditions, your veterinarian may need a fecal analysis, bloodwork, X-ray, or ultrasound.

Diagnosis for AHDS in Dogs

Your vet will also consider AHDS as a possible cause if your dog has bloody, watery diarrhea; dehydration; and an elevated packed cell volume (the number of red blood cells currently circulating).

There is no specific test to diagnose AHDS in dogs. If no other cause is found for your dog’s symptoms, a diagnosis of AHDS may be made as a ""diagnosis of exclusion.”

An Addisonian crisis, which is when a dog with Addison’s disease has acute gastrointestinal symptoms that are often bloody, can look exactly like AHDS. This is fatal if untreated.

Since an Addisonian crisis and AHDS are both so serious, it is critical to take your dog to the vet immediately if they are dehydrated or have bloody diarrhea.

Treatment for Gastroenteritis in Dogs
The goal of treatment is to stop the vomiting/diarrhea and maintain hydration.

Depending on your dog’s condition and the underlying cause, your veterinarian may administer anti-vomiting medication, antibiotics, and antacid medications specifically formulated for dogs.

If your dog is vomiting, the medications will be administered through injection. Your dog may also require hospitalization for IV (intravenous) fluids and electrolytes.

Treatment for AHDS in Dogs

AHDS is very serious and cannot be treated at home. If your dog has bloody diarrhea or vomit, go to the emergency vet immediately.

Dogs with AHDS are losing a life-threatening amount of fluid, protein, and electrolytes, and they must be hospitalized for aggressive IV therapy, electrolyte supplementation, and medication.

With AHDS, the survival rate is 90–95% if appropriate, aggressive therapy is started quickly. Most dogs recover in two or three days.

Recovery and Management of Gastroenteritis in Dogs
After your dog comes home from the vet, you can continue care. If the vet finds that your dog’s gastroenteritis is caused by something that’s contagious, isolate your dog from your other pets. Do not allow your dog to eat or drink until there has been no vomiting for six to eight hours.

Then you may give your dog small amounts of clear liquids (water, Gatorade, Pedialyte, or other electrolyte solution) every two hours.

If your dog does not vomit the fluid after 12 hours, give frequent, small meals of boiled hamburger and rice or boiled chicken and rice, about ¼ cup or less per feeding. Your vet might also send you home with samples of a low-fat, easily digestible prescription diet such as these

Part of your dog’s recovery plan from AHDS should be a bland diet that’s high in carbohydrates and low in protein and fat. Your vet may offer you special canned food, or you can cook for your dog.

Cooked rice or pasta; potatoes with some cottage cheese; lean, boiled ground beef; or skinless chicken are good choices for a couple of weeks as your dog's gut heals and their appetite returns. Ask your veterinarian about options for cooking for your dog to ensure that you provide the right nutrients in the right amounts.
Gastroenteritis in Dogs FAQsHow can I treat my dog’s gastroenteritis at home?If your dog is vomiting or has diarrhea, you should always call your veterinarian. They can ask you specific questions to help assess how serious the situation is.

If your dog is lethargic or showing blood in their vomit or diarrhea, take them to the vet immediately. Dogs with AHDS need to be hospitalized for care and cannot be managed safely at home.

After a vet evaluates your dog’s symptoms, they might determine that your dog can be safely managed at home, and they will give you a treatment plan for home care. This may include giving your dog small amounts of clear liquids (water, Gatorade, Pedialyte, or other electrolyte solution) every 2 hours, but only after vomiting has stopped for 6 to 8 hours.

If your dog does not vomit the fluid after 12 hours, give frequent, small meals of boiled hamburger and rice or boiled chicken and rice, about ¼ cup or less per feeding. Do not give your dog over-the-counter or prescription medication unless you speak to your veterinarian.
Can gastroenteritis kill dogs?Yes. Gastroenteritis can often become acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS) when left untreated. This is the most acute form of gastroenteritis in dogs and can lead to life-threatening dehydration if not treated quickly.
Is gastroenteritis contagious from dogs to humans?Some of the causes of gastroenteritis are zoonotic, meaning they are contagious from dogs to humans. Bacterial infections like E. coli, salmonella, and listeria would fall into this category.

Some of the causes are specific to dogs and harmless to humans, such as canine parvovirus and distemper.

Vomiting is the active process (with abdominal effort and retching) of expelling the stomach’s contents.

Either vomiting or regurgitation may contain fluid, food, bile or foreign material. In cases where the lining of the esophagus or stomach is irritated, blood may also be present in the contents.

Animals that are not actively vomiting may still be experiencing nausea. Nausea can be more subtle and may appear as little or no appetite, turning away from food or excessive salivation.

Diarrhea may come on suddenly and will often progress in frequency, amount, urgency and consistency over hours to days. It is helpful to provide your veterinarian with as much detail as possible as it can help them know which causes to focus on, including whether the small or large bowel is involved.

Abdominal pain with gastroenteritis can range from mild to severe. This may be difficult to gauge at home, however. Look for signs such as pacing, restlessness or unwillingness to move, or a ‘praying posture’ stance, which indicate that your pet may be experiencing abdominal pain.",ASC965

What Is Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats?
To move blood through the body, the four chambers of the heart must expand and contract in a precise way. While the heartbeat can speed up or slow down depending on the needs of the body, it does so with a consistent rhythm controlled by electric signals that move in a very specific path through the heart muscles. When this path is interrupted or when signals are generated abnormally, it results in a cardiac arrhythmia.

Arrhythmias are relatively uncommon in cats. A recent study found arrhythmias in only 2.6% of cats. Most cardiac arrhythmias in cats indicate structural issues in the heart or systemic disease, though some irregular heartbeats can be found in normal heart function.

When arrhythmias are due to disease, the heart’s chambers can contract out of sync, and blood will not flow through the lungs and to the body properly. This leads to decreased oxygen in the tissues and can cause fluid buildup in the lungs, chest, and abdomen. 

Cats are very good at hiding signs of disease, so even when arrhythmias are due to illness, symptoms are often hard to spot until the situation is severe. Arrhythmias can be life-threatening, depending on the type and cause.

If you notice symptoms of a cardiac arrhythmia in your cat, take them to the veterinarian immediately.

Types of Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats

There are several alterations to the heart’s pattern that can cause cardiac arrhythmias in cats, including:


	
	Sinus arrhythmia—A rate change with normal signal transmission that is not a concern for a cat’s health. No symptoms are typically shown, and heart function is normal. The heart rate changes to match the cat’s breathing pattern.
	
	
	AV block—Occurs when the signal between the top of the heart and bottom of the heart gets interrupted. It usually sounds like a very slow heart rate (bradycardia). If the signal is only delayed (first-degree block), treatment is not needed. Severe heart block stops the signal entirely and can be life-threatening.
	
	
	Premature beats—In these arrhythmias, the signal to contract starts in an abnormal place. These abnormal rhythms are described based on where the signal starts—either supraventricular premature contractions (SVPC) from the top of the heart or ventricular premature contractions (VPC) from the bottom of the heart.
	


Isolated SVPCs and VPCs are usually not of concern and can occur in normal patients, but if these signals occur quickly, they can lead to fast heart rates called supraventricular tachycardia or ventricular tachycardia. This doesn’t allow normal function of the heart.

Cats with these arrhythmias may show panting and collapse. If left untreated, these arrhythmias can be fatal.

Symptoms of Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats
Symptoms of arrhythmias can be difficult for pet parents to see, and many cats will have no obvious clinical signs. Unfortunately, in some cases of arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia, no symptoms are seen until sudden death occurs.

Subtle changes that can be seen are a decreased appetite and your cat sleeping more. These signs may come and go if the arrhythmia is not constant.

You may also want to look out for symptoms of disease that can lead to arrhythmias. Weight loss, increased thirst, or vomiting should prompt an evaluation of your kitty for hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and intestinal disease.

Symptoms of severe cardiac arrhythmias in cats include:


	
	Syncope (fainting)
	
	
	Increased respiratory rate
	
	
	Open-mouth breathing
	
	
	Abdominal distension
	


If you notice any of these symptoms, take your cat to an emergency veterinary hospital immediately.

Causes of Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats
Most arrhythmias in cats are due to underlying structural heart disease. Cats may be born with abnormal heart development (congenital heart disease).

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are primarily genetic, progressive diseases that lead to extremely thick (in HCM) or thin (in DCM) heart muscles. Infection and trauma can also make enough change to the heart muscle to cause an arrhythmia.

High blood pressure, low red blood cell count (anemia), alterations in the nervous system,  and certain electrolyte changes in the bloodstream can lead to arrhythmias even when the heart structure stays normal.

Hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, cancer, and certain toxins have all been linked to arrhythmias. If these conditions can be treated, the arrhythmias usually resolve.

Arrhythmias can occur in any cat of any age of any breed, but breeds like Ragdolls, Himalayans, and Siamese are more predisposed to structural heart disease and arrhythmias. A recent study found that abnormal heart rhythms are also more common in male cats and older cats.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats
Typically, veterinarians diagnose cardiac arrhythmia in cats with a full physical exam. If your vet hears a heart murmur (abnormal heart sounds), further testing may be needed even if they don’t hear an abnormal rhythm.

To determine which arrhythmia your cat has, an electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed. This maps out the electric signal that the heart muscle is sending. These electric signals are different for each type of arrhythmia.

In cases where an arrhythmia is intermittent, your vet may recommend a Holter monitor, a small vest that runs an ECG for 24 hours while your cat behaves normally at home. Usually this is enough to catch even the most minor arrhythmia. 

Your vet will recommend blood work to evaluate kidney function, electrolyte levels, and thyroid levels, as these systemic issues may be causing the abnormal rhythm and can be treated directly.

To look for underlying heart disease, your vet may recommend a specific blood test called a proBNP, which detects elevated levels of the proBNP hormone when the heart muscle is stretched abnormally.

Chest X-rays may or may not show heart enlargement in cats with heart disease, but they should be performed to look for fluid buildup or enlarged vessels that may indicate heart failure.

An echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) with a veterinary cardiologist will give the best information about the structure and internal function of your cat’s heart. This is the best way to look for heart muscle abnormalities like HCM and DCM and determine how severe the heart disease is.

Treatment of Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats
Treatment of arrhythmias is highly dependent on the underlying cause. While medications to alter heart rhythm and rate exist, they are rarely used in cats because underlying issues are so common. Arrhythmias caused by thyroid disease, kidney disease, or low red blood cell counts will need to have those conditions treated directly.

Arrhythmias due to structural heart disease like HCM or DCM may be managed with medications to improve heart function and slow heart rate. Unfortunately, cardiomyopathies are diseases that are managed, not cured, and heart function may worsen over time despite treatment.

Pacemakers may be placed for rare cases where the arrhythmia is only due to electrical misfiring, such as AV block. These implants directly control the electrical signal to a cat’s heart muscle. Pacemakers are not used in cats who already have structural changes and remodeling of the heart muscle.

Recovery and Management of Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats
Recovery of cardiac arrhythmia in cats also depends on the underlying cause. Mild heart disease or systemic diseases like hyperthyroidism can usually be managed on an outpatient basis with oral medications. Severe kidney failure and heart failure may require hospitalization and intensive care.

Whether inpatient or outpatient, most arrhythmias require frequent monitoring with your veterinarian to avoid progression.

The goal with arrythmia management is for cats to live a normal life at home. Due to the increased risk of fainting, cats with arrhythmias should remain indoor-only and may benefit from having food and litter on the same level of your home so they don’t have to navigate stairs.

Prevention of Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats
Unfortunately, there’s not much the pet parent can do to prevent cardiac arrhythmias in cats. But annual exams and routine blood work can help find arrhythmias and their causes before the disease becomes severe.

One form of dilated cardiomyopathy has been linked to low taurine levels in a cat’s diet. The majority of well-balanced commercial cat foods now have taurine added to avoid this issue.
Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats FAQsWhat do I do if my cat’s heart is beating fast?If you notice an elevated heart rate in your cat, it’s important to look for other symptoms.

If your cat is breathing normally, eating well, and playful, it’s reasonable to call your vet for a non-emergency visit to discuss the high heart rate.

If your cat is visibly in pain, breathing very fast or panting, has recently collapsed, or is not eating their meals, an emergency vet visit is needed. There are no treatments to be performed at home in these situations.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel to rule out other diseases.

An analysis of cerebrospinal fluid may indicate increased protein levels without an increase  in cell count, which is indicative of astrocytoma development. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also highly instrumental in diagnosing astrocytomas, as is radionuclide imaging, which may show an area of increased activity at the tumor site.



Treatment

Surgery and chemotherapy are both common courses of treatment when dealing with this time of brain tumor. Radiation therapy, too, can be effective; consult a veterinary oncologist if this is beneficial in the case of your cat.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule regular follow-up appointments for your pet, where it will undergo CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans, so as to monitor the cat's response to treatment. Likewise, blood work (especially a complete blood count) should be evaluated during each appointment.

705,"Aspergillosis in Cats



Aspergillosis is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by the Aspergillus, a species of common mold found throughout the environment, including dust, straw, grass clippings, and hay. An opportunistic infection occurs when an organism which does not generally cause disease becomes an infectious agent once it has entered into an animals body. In the case of Aspergillosis, it becomes an infectious agent when the body's immune system is weakened from some other disease or illness.



There are two types of acquired Aspergillus infection: nasal and disseminated. Both types can affect cats, and while no particular breed is more prone than another, Persians show a slightly higher incidence.

 

Symptoms and Types

 

There are two types of Aspergillus infections. The first is the nasal form, where the infection is localized in the nasal passages and front sinuses. It is believed that this develops from direct nasal contact with the fungus. For example, if a cat is outside and around dust and grass clippings, the fungus may enter via the moist lining of the nose. The most commonly associated symptoms are nasal discharge and noisy breathing during inhaling.

 

The second type of Aspergillus infection is disseminated, meaning it is more widespread in the body, not only in the nasal area. It is not certain how this form enters the body. Disseminated aspergillosis is most commonly associated with nonspecific signs, such as lethargy, depression, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other symptoms may include protruding eyeballs.

 

Causes

 

The Aspergillus fungus is commonly found in the environment in substances such as dust, hay, and grass. As an opportunistic infection, it is only likely to infect cats with an immune system that is already in a weakened state. Cats exhibiting immunodeficiency -- an inability to produce a normal immune response -- are at higher risk, and cats with illnesses such as diabetes or feline leukemia virus (FeLV) may also be more susceptible to this infection.

 

Diagnosis

 

Diagnostic procedures vary depending on whether the infection is based in the nasal passages or is disseminated through the body. For suspected nasal aspergillosis, analysis of nasal swabs, fungal cultures of nasal discharge, and a rhinoscopy -- inserting a small fiber-optic scope into the nose in order to examine the inside of the nose and its mucus linings -- can be expected. The symptoms for disseminated aspergillosis are mostly nonspecific and therefore more difficult to diagnose. Tests may include a urine analysis and X-rays to examine the spine.

 

  

 



Treatment

 

There have been successful treatments through the administration of an antifungal drug directly into the nose or further in the nasal passage. If antifungal cat medication is prescribed, you will need to follow the full course of the medication s that symptoms do no recur.

 

Living and Management

 

Continued treatment depends on the type and severity of aspergillosis. Cats with the nasal version should be monitored for reduced nasal discharge, while those with disseminated disease need to be monitored with urine analysis and X-ray every one to two months. Your veterinarian will recommend a treatment plan to monitor your cat's progress.

 

Prevention

 

General good health will help to ensure a strong and healthy immune system so that this opportunistic disease is not a cause for concern. A balanced diet with opportunities for physical activity are essential components of a healthy lifestyle for your cat. Keeping your cat indoors may also be helpful, as it will limit access to grass clippings, hay, straw, and other substances where the Aspergillus fungus grows.

SNA is characterized by local signs of chronic nasal infection, such as sneezing, uni- or bilateral serous to mucopurulent nasal discharge, and sometimes epistaxis.

The fungus is contracted through the dog's nasal passages and then passes into the brain, eyes, lungs, and other tissues. It is usually rare in dogs.



The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.



Symptoms



Symptoms will vary and depend greatly on the organ systems affected by the fungus. However, animals may have a history of problems for weeks or months, be especially sluggish, and (in less than 50 percent of animals) have a mild fever. Other symptoms include:




	Nervous system signs — seizures, wobbly, uncoordinated or “drunken” movements weakness, blindness
	Skin ulceration
	Enlarged lymph nodes
	Vomiting and diarrhea
	Lack of appetite
	Nasal discharge




Causes



The Cryptococcus yeast is usually inhaled through the nasal passages. Occasionally, these organisms may reach the terminal airways, although it is unlikely.



It can also infect the stomach and the intestines, entering through the gastrointestinal tract.



Diagnosis

 

Your veterinarian will be making a diagnosis based on findings from the following tests:




	Samples will be taken from the nasal passages, or a biopsy from the bumpy tissue that protrudes from the nasal passages; flushing the nose with saline may dislodge infected tissue
	Biopsy of skin lesions of the head
	Aspirates of affected lymph nodes
	Blood and urine cultures
	Blood tests to detect the presence of Cryptococcus antigens
	If your dog is showing symptoms of neurological disease, a spinal tap and examination of cells will need to be done


 





Treatment



Any nervous systems shown in your animal may require inpatient supportive care. Outpatient care is used when the dog is stable.



Surgery is recommended if the dog has nodular (granulomatous) masses in its nose and throat; removal of these masses will alleviate breathing difficulties.



Living and Management



Monitor blood work (liver enzymes) monthly in dogs receiving antifungal drugs. Improvement in clinical signs, resolution of lesions, improvement in well being, and return of appetite measure response to treatment. Conduct blood tests that detect the presence of antigens of Cryptococcus.



Anticipated duration of treatment is three months to one year; patients with central nervous system disease may require lifelong maintenance treatment.



Measure the presence of antigens of Cryptococcus every two months, and up until six months after completion of treatment (or until the antigen is no longer detectable). If patient maintains low titers -- the amount of medicine or antibodies found in a patient's blood – for several months after all signs of disease have resolved, continue the treatment for at least three months. If titers suddenly rise after treatment, resume the therapy.

	Vomiting and diarrhea
	Lack of appetite
	Nasal discharge




Causes



The Cryptococcus yeast is usually inhaled through the nasal passages. Occasionally, these organisms may reach the terminal airways, although it is unlikely.



It can also infect the stomach and the intestines, entering through the gastrointestinal tract.



Diagnosis

 

Your veterinarian will be making a diagnosis based on findings from the following tests:




	Samples will be taken from the nasal passages, or a biopsy from the bumpy tissue that protrudes from the nasal passages; flushing the nose with saline may dislodge infected tissue
	Biopsy of skin lesions of the head
	Aspirates of affected lymph nodes
	Blood and urine cultures
	Blood tests to detect the presence of Cryptococcus antigens
	If your dog is showing symptoms of neurological disease, a spinal tap and examination of cells will need to be done


 





Treatment



Any nervous systems shown in your animal may require inpatient supportive care. Outpatient care is used when the dog is stable.



Surgery is recommended if the dog has nodular (granulomatous) masses in its nose and throat; removal of these masses will alleviate breathing difficulties.



Living and Management



Monitor blood work (liver enzymes) monthly in dogs receiving antifungal drugs. Improvement in clinical signs, resolution of lesions, improvement in well being, and return of appetite measure response to treatment. Conduct blood tests that detect the presence of antigens of Cryptococcus.



Anticipated duration of treatment is three months to one year; patients with central nervous system disease may require lifelong maintenance treatment.



Measure the presence of antigens of Cryptococcus every two months, and up until six months after completion of treatment (or until the antigen is no longer detectable). If patient maintains low titers -- the amount of medicine or antibodies found in a patient's blood – for several months after all signs of disease have resolved, continue the treatment for at least three months. If titers suddenly rise after treatment, resume the therapy.

755,"Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease that may affect the respiratory tract (especially the nasal cavity), central nervous system, eyes, and skin (particularly of the face and neck) of cats. It is caused by the fungi Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, which are found worldwide in soil and bird manure, especially in pigeon droppings. Transmission is by inhalation of spores or contamination of wounds.

Cryptococcosis is most common in cats, although it also occurs in other domestic and wild animals. In cats, upper respiratory signs following infection of the nasal cavity are most common. The signs often include sneezing; bloody, clear, or pus-filled nasal discharge; polyp-like mass(es) in the nostril; and a firm swelling under the skin and over the bridge of the nose. Areas of small raised bumps and nodules may affect the skin; these may feel soft (liquid filled) or firm. These areas may ulcerate, leaving a raw surface. Neurologic signs associated with cryptococcosis of the central nervous system include depression, changes in temperament, seizures, circling, slight paralysis, and blindness. Eye abnormalities may also develop.",ASC955

758,"Symptoms of Cryptococcosis in Cats
Because cats typically inhale the spores through their nose, upper respiratory symptoms are the most common:

Sneezing

Hard swelling over the bridge of the nose

Polyps in the nasal passages, which may cause difficulty breathing

Nasal discharge that may be blood-tinged, yellow, clear, or a combination of mucus and pus

Less often, the fungus may infect the lungs and cause coughing and rapid labored breathing. Skin lesions are also commonly seen on cats with this fungal disease, appearing as nodules or papules that can be fluid-filled or firm. Sometimes large ulcers that may drain fluid appear on the skin.

 A cat's central nervous system (CNS) may also be affected by the fungal organism, which may lead to the following symptoms:

Depression

Behavioral changes

Walking in circles

Seizures

Muscular weakness

Dilated pupils, even when light is directed at the eyes (which may progress to blindness)",ASC955

Cryptococcosis in cats' symptoms depends on the type of infection, which may vary from animal to animal. The four types are:

Nasal cryptococcosis 

This is the most common form that affects the respiratory tract of the cat. Nasal cryptococcosis causes difficulty in breathing, followed by loss of appetite, weight loss, loss of balance, and possible ear problems. 

Other common symptoms are:

Chronic nasal discharge
Heavy or loud breathing
Swelling of the face and nose
Sneezing
Non-healing wounds on the nose
A visible collection of masses in the nasal cavity",ASC955
761,"Central nervous system (CNS) cryptococcosis 

This form of cryptococcosis happens when the nasal form spreads into the cat's brain from the nasal cavity. Cats with CNS cryptococcosis experience severe behavioral and nervous changes, including:

Sudden blindness
Seizures 
Spinal or head pain",ASC955
762,"In cats, chronic cryptococcosis is common, usually limited to the upper respiratory tract. Clinical signs secondary to nasal cavity infection are most common and include sneezing; mucopurulent, serous, or hemorrhagic unilateral or bilateral chronic nasal discharge; polyplike mass(es) in the nostril; and/or a firm, subcutaneous swelling over the bridge of the nose. Cutaneous lesions are also common and are characterized by papules and nodules that are fluctuant to firm.

Larger lesions tend to ulcerate, leaving a raw surface with a serous exudate. Neurologic signs associated with cryptococcosis of the CNS may include depression, changes in temperament, seizures, circling, paresis, and blindness. Ocular abnormalities may also develop, including dilated unresponsive pupils and blindness due to exudative retinal detachment, granulomatous chorioretinitis, panophthalmitis, and optic neuritis.

803,"Rhinosporidiosis in Dogs

Rhinosporidiosis is a very rare chronic (long-term) infection that typically occurs in the mucous membranes of dogs. It most commonly occurs in the nose and nostrils, but can also take hold in the nose and eyes. Rhinosporidiosis belongs to the zoonotic class of fungal infections, meaning that it can be transmitted to humans.

Symptoms and Types

Signs and symptoms of rhinosporidiosis include the following: sneezing, bleeding, wheezing, or labored breathing; an infection of the nostrils with a cauliflower-like growth; a polyp or other growth located near or on the nostril - this growth may be white or yellowish in color and may appear speckled or spotted because of the fungus associated with the growth.

Humans will sometimes contract a form of this infection. In instances like this, one might notice a small growth or polyp on the reproductive organs, including the penis or vagina, or a growth along the ears or near the eyes. However, this type of fungal infection is exceedingly rare in dogs, and even more so in human beings.

Causes

The primary cause of rhinosporidiosis is infection with the fungus rhinosporidium seeberi. Risk factors include frequent exposure to stagnant or standing water, and living in a dry and dusty climate.

Diagnosis

The best way to diagnose an infection caused by rhinosporidium seeberi is by examining the polyp or nasal growth, or examining the abnormal cells caused by the fungus. Your veterinarian can do this by removing the polyp, or by removing part of the affected tissue for bioptic examination.

Your doctor may also find it necessary to order a radiograph or x-ray of the nasal cavity; however, these typically will return as normal, as will other types of tests, including urine tests and blood tests.



The fungus responsible for this rare type of infection may show up on other types of findings, including what are known as histopathologic findings. These include diagnostic tests of epithelial or skin cell analysis, and testing of organisms in the surrounding tissues. A medical professional may excise or cut away the mass, or perform a rhinotomy, which involves cutting into part of the nose to remove the infected tissue.

To confirm a diagnosis, your veterinarian will usually confirm the pathologic findings, which will typically show ulcers in the skin cells, an abnormal increase in the number of cells within the tissue surrounding the nose or nostril, and fibrous tissue surrounding the nasal cells. Lab testing will show an inflammatory reaction within the skin cells if the fungal organisms are released into the surrounding skin and nasal tissue, making identification of the fungus possible.

Treatment

Treatment involves proper hygiene and proper attention to wound care. It is important to keep your pet confined, or within a cage, during recovery, and to keep the area clean and free of debris, to prevent the possibility of re-infection.

Living and Management

It is important to return to your veterinarian for follow up care so that your pet can be checked for any re-growth or complications. In some cases it is impossible to remove the entire growth during a preliminary surgery, so it may be necessary for your doctor to repeat some procedures or provide additional care. Because it is possible for humans to become infected with rhinosporidiosis, it is important to practice good hygiene at all times.
