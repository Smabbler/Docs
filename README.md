### What is Galaxia?
---
**Galaxia** is a graph language model (GLM) and knowledge graph platform that automates the transformation of unstructured data into structured and semantically rich graphs. It combines graph-based data structures with natural language processing to build a transparent and flexible system for organizing, retrieving and reasoning over information.

Unlike generative models, Galaxia does not produce new content. It focuses on extracting meaning from existing data - no training, embeddings or manual labeling required.

### Key Features
---

- **Automated Graph Construction**  
  Converts unstructured text into structured, interconnected knowledge by automatically extracting entities and relationships - eliminating the need for manual NLP preprocessing.
- **Knowledge Augmentation (Data Level)**  
  Enriches input data with additional context such as synonyms, taxonomies and similarities to support more accurate retrieval and understanding. Replaces the need for traditional embeddings.
- **Knowledge Augmentation (AI Model Level)**  
  Enhances AI models by injecting external domain knowledge, represented as graph structures, at inference time. Improves reasoning, accuracy and context awareness (Galaxia Graph RAG).
- **Semantic Retrieval**  
  Retrieves information based on semantic relationships in the graph, not just vector similarity - enabling more accurate and explainable results.
- **Automated Retrieval**  
  Uses built-in, flexible algorithms to automatically locate and extract relevant information from the graph with no manual query engineering required.
- **In-Memory Processing**  
  Graphs are processed directly in RAM, making retrieval fast and easily scalable.
- **Retrieval Transparency**  
  Provides clear visibility into which data was used for a result and how data points are connected.

### Integrations
---

Galaxia integrates with common AI frameworks for easy use in existing pipelines:

- [LangChain – Galaxia Retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/retrievers/galaxia-retriever/)
- [LlamaIndex – Galaxia Retriever](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/tree/main/llama-index-integrations/retrievers/llama-index-retrievers-galaxia)
